Aldous v. Greater Taree City Council and Another,"An Australian court upheld approval of a development application by a city council for a dwelling on a beachfront property. Applicant land owner argued, inter alia, that the Council had failed to take into account the principles of ecologically sustainable development (ESD), specifically the principles of intergenerational equity and the precautionary principles by failing to assess climate change induced coastal erosion. The Council was in the process of conducting a coastal impact study, but made its decision prior to the completion of the study. The court concluded that the Council had a mandatory obligation under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 to take into consideration the public interest, which included the principles of ESD, but in the present case, the defendant had considered the issue of coastal erosion.",,['Australia>New South Wales>Land and Environment Court'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Climate adaptation'],['Australia'],,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/aldous-v-greater-taree-city-council-and-another/

Haughton v. Minister for Department of Planning and Others,"Ned Haughton challenged the approval granted by the Minister for Planning for two coal-fired power plants.  The challenge was on the grounds that: (1) the Minister erroneously approved the plants on the basis that they were critical infrastructure projects; (2) the Minister had not fully considered the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and (3) the Minister had not considered the impact of the projects on climate change, which was required of him based on his duty to protect the public interest.  While the Court upheld the standing of Mr. Haughton to bring the case, it dismissed his substantive claims on the basis that the decisions had been made within the power given to the Minister under Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment  Act 1979 (NSW).  Justice Craig emphasized that he could not review the merits of the Ministers decision, and could only consider its legality.  He concluded that the statute allowed the Minister to weigh competing considerations as he saw fit when determining what was in the public interest.",Application dismissed,['Australia>New South Wales>Land and Environment Court'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Utilities'],"['Australia>Precautionary Principle', 'Australia>Principle of Intergenerational Equity']",Challenge to government approval of two coal-fired power plants,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/haughton-v-minister-for-department-of-planning-and-ors/
Able Lott Holdings Pty. Ltd. v. City of Fremantle,"This case concerned a development application for retrospective approval of partially completed alterations and additions to an historic warehouse building. One of the principal issues related to potential flooding and the decision is the first to apply the State Coastal Planning Policy anticipating a 0.38 meter increase in sea level due to climate change. The Tribunal determined that the development application warranted conditional approval. With respect to potential flooding, the Tribunal found that the level of the water table over the lifetime of the development, including anticipated increase in the water table due to sea level rise by 2100, would not compromise the structural stability of the building or cause water ingress. Thus, the proposal did not warrant refusal because of potential for flooding. The development application was approved subject to 40 conditions including conditions to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate having regard to heritage and amenity considerations.

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission v. GM Holden Ltd.,"The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) filed a suit against GM Holden Ltd for wrongly advertising that Saab vehicles provided carbon neutral motoring.  GM Holden had claimed that Saab would plant 17 native trees for every Saab vehicle purchased to offset the carbon emissions.  ACCC filed its claim on the basis that GM Holden had not shown any change in the way it manufactured Saab vehicles subsequent to its carbon neutral campaign and that GM Holdens claim that 17 native trees would offset the carbon emissions was not proven and was misleading.  The Federal Court declared that GM Holden had breached sections 52 and 53(c) of the Trade Practices Act 1974.

Blue Wedges objected to the Ministers process of approval on three grounds: (1) the Minister had not taken into account the principles of ecologically sustainable development while considering the proposal, as required by section 136(2)(a) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act; (2) the Minister had not adequately informed and consulted all other relevant ministers, including the Minister for Climate Change and Water, who could have a concern with the effect which the channel deepening project might have on sea levels and tidal level changes in the Bay, as required by section 131(1) of the EPBC Act; and (3) the Minister had failed to fully consider the impacts on listed threatened and migratory species as outlined by section 136(1)(a) of the EPBC Act.  After thorough review of the claims made by the applicant, the court held that all considerations brought up by the applicant had been adequately met by the Minister in his review prior to issuing the approval for the proposal.",Denied: Council may require CHVA,['Australia>Federal Court of Australia'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Climate adaptation'],['Australia>Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Federal)'],Approval of permit application without a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment (CHVA),https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/blue-wedges-inc-v-minister-for-environment-heritage-and-the-arts/

Byron Shire Council v. Vaughan; Vaughan v. Byron Shire Council,"After strong storms and increased coastal erosion, John and Anne Vaughan attempted to rebuild an interim sandbag wall that was previously approved by the city council in a 2001 development consent.  The council sought an injunction from the court preventing the wall from being rebuilt, arguing that the council had a policy of planned retreat and that rebuilding the wall could cause damage to other properties, especially if it was built without the approval of the council. The Vaughans responded by bringing an action against the council, alleging breach by the council of the 2001 development consent.  The court upheld the councils request and issued an injunction preventing the wall from being rebuilt. The two parties later came to a settlement before the final hearing allowing the Vaughans to rebuild the wall using geobags and sand as opposed to rocks, which they had initially planned to use.

Subsequent to Byron Shire Council v. Vaughan; Vaughan v. Byron Shire Council and the settlement reached between the parties, John and Anne Vaughan requested that the injunction preventing them from rebuilding the wall be discharged and the costs incurred be reserved.

Carey v. Murrindindi Shire Council,"At issue in this case was a proposal to build a community hall in an area that was badly burnt by bushfires in February 2009. Citizens objected to the proposal and appealed the Councils decision to grant a permit for the building due to the fire risks associated with the proposal. The Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal relied upon the strong community need for the community hall but nevertheless recognized that a prudent approach was needed and that climate change predictions suggested that Victoria would experience more extreme fires in the future. Accordingly, the Tribunal dealt with the risk of loss of life with respect to bushfire risks by imposing conditions on the permit ensuring that the loss of life risks were reduced to a manageable level. To this respect, one interesting condition imposed by the Tribunal was that the community hall could not be occupied until an Emergency Management Plan had been prepared by the permit holder.

Clean Energy Regulator v. MT Solar Pty. Ltd.,"This case concerned the penalties to be imposed on an unlicensed electrician, the company which employed him to install solar panels and other related parties.  As the electrician did not have the appropriate accreditation to install the solar panels, the company was not entitled to claim Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) under the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (Cth).  The federal authority in charge of administering the issuance of RECs, the Clean Energy Regulator, sought civil penalties against the respondents for contravening the Act by providing false information as to the qualifications of the electrician. In discussing the factual background to the case, Justice Foster noted that a state government feed-in tariff offered for renewable energy projects had created significant market pressure for projects to be delivered quickly (the tariff was only available through 2016), and that there had been a shortage of qualified electricians to meet the demand.",Penalties imposed,['Australia>Federal Court of Australia'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading'],['Australia>Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (Federal)'],To impose penalties for providing false information to the government regarding the installation of solar panels and claiming of Renewable Energy Certificates,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clean-energy-regulator-v-mt-solar-pty-ltd/

Dual Gas Pty. Ltd. and Others v.

Four objectors challenged the approval in an Australia state court, including Environment Victoria, which asserted that the project would be inconsistent with Victorias State Environment Protection Policy (SEPP). Dual Gas challenged the objectors standing, sought review of conditions on the works approval requiring a specific level of operation efficiency, SO2 capture, and noise attenuation, and sought to reinstate the originally proposed generating capacity of 600 MWe. The court found that three of the four objectors had standing because they had interests that would be affected by the project. However, the court rejected their challenges finding that the project was consistent with best practices requirements and the general goals of the SEPP.

Environment Victoria Inc. v. Department of Primary Industries,"The applicant, an NGO, submitted a request  to the respondent under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth) (FOIA) for documents relating to: the possible allocation of new licenses to mine brown coal in the Latrobe Valley; reductions to the premium solar feed-in tariff paid to consumers who contribute electricity to the power grid from solar panels; and changes to the planning controls over wind farms. The Department failed to respond to the request within 45 days (as required by the Act). After proceedings were commenced, some documents were produced and issues in dispute were eventually narrowed to four particular documents.  Three of these documents related to allocation of licenses to mine coal, and the fourth related to the premium feed-in tariff scheme.  In withholding these documents, the Department relied on an exception to FOIA which protects cabinet documents (for the three coal related documents), and an exception which protects internal working documents (in relation to all four documents). The Tribunal held that, with the exception of an introductory portion of one document, that the three coal license related documents were protected by the exception for internal working documents, as they had been prepared in order to brief the Minister on issues of the utmost importance to Victorians.  The high level nature of the briefing documents, and the sensitivity of the issues involved, were considerations that weighed against their release under FOIA.  The document relating to the premium feed-in tariff scheme was held not to be protected by any of the exceptions.",Application approved in part,['Australia>Victoria>Civil and Administrative Tribunal'],['Suits against governments>Access to information'],['Australia>Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Federal)'],Application for access to information relating to coal licenses and a feed-in tariff scheme,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/environment-victoria-inc-v-department-of-primary-industries/

Gray v. Minister for Planning,"An Australian federal court rejected an environmental impact assessment (EIA) prepared as part of a development approval process for a large open-cut coal mine at Anvil Hill.  Coal from the proposed mine is destined for use in coal-fired power stations in Australia and overseas.  The proponents of the project failed to consider the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the burning of coal by third parties.  The court held that for projects with the potential to directly or indirectly contribute to GHG emissions, the climate change impacts of the proposal should be properly considered and assessed under the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979.  It is not sufficient to simply raise the climate change issue in the EIA; the proponent of the project must attempt precise quantifications.

Haughton v. Minister for Department of Planning and Others,"Ned Haughton challenged the approval granted by the Minister for Planning for two coal-fired power plants.  The challenge was on the grounds that: (1) the Minister erroneously approved the plants on the basis that they were critical infrastructure projects; (2) the Minister had not fully considered the principles of ecologically sustainable development; and (3) the Minister had not considered the impact of the projects on climate change, which was required of him based on his duty to protect the public interest.

Hunter Community Environment Centre Inc. v. Minister for Planning and Delta Electricity,"Hunter Community Environment Centre Inc challenged the Minister for Plannings approval of the refurbishment of a coal-fired power plant proposed by Delta Electricity. While several grounds of appeal were raised in submissions by the applicant, only two were pursued during the hearing.  The first of these grounds for review was an alleged a failure to comply with s 75I(2)(g) of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) which requires the Director-General's report to the Minister to include a statement relating to compliance with environmental assessment requirements. Secondly, the Applicant alleged that the statement of compliance in that report was misleading in relation to fly ash disposal measures. The Court dismissed both alleged grounds of review. In relation to the first ground, the Court disagreed with the applicants interpretation of the relevant statutory provision.  In relation to the second, the Court noted that the Minister had imposed a condition on the project relating to the disposal of fly ash and that his consideration of the issue had been sufficient.",Dismissed,['Australia>New South Wales>Land and Environment Court'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Utilities'],"['Australia>Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)', 'Australia>Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW)']",Challenge to government approval of coal-fired power plant,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/hunter-community-environment-centre-inc-v-minister-for-planning-and-delta-electricity/
Hunter Environment Lobby Inc. v. Minister for Planning,"The case relates to the approval of diverse extensions of a coalmine, leading to an increase of annual production of up to 20 million tones of coal. The Hunter Environment Lobby objected to the proposal, notably on the ground that the extensions would have an important impact on climate change. Nevertheless, the project was approved by the Planning Minister in November 2010 and the Hunter Environment Lobby appealed. In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions. The Court thus affirmed the approval, but subject to certain conditions, including a condition which required the offset of any direct GHG emissions from the mine. This condition could be suspended if another law or regulation was introduced which would cover these emissions. 

Following this initial decision, the Australian Government introduced a carbon price, which was implemented through federal legislation.  In light of this new scheme, in a subsequent decision the Court held that it was valid for the Minister to decide that the condition on the mine relating to offsetting of direct emissions was no longer necessary.",Challenge upheld in part,['Australia>New South Wales>Land and Environment Court'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],['Australia>Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW)'],Challenge to conditions imposed on approval of a coal mine,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/hunter-environment-lobby-inc-v-minister-for-planning/

Macquarie Generation v. Hodgson,"Peter Gray & Naomi Hodgson v. Macquarie Generation [2010] NSWLEC 34: Environmental activists brought suit against a state-owned power company, seeking a declaratory judgment that one of their power stations had been emitting carbon dioxide into the atmosphere in a manner that has harmed or is likely to harm the environment in contravention of  115(1) of the Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997. Defendant Macquarie Generations motion for summary dismissal was denied on March 22, 2010, although Justice Pain did dismiss the applicants case in part. The court found that even if Defendant has an implied authority to emit some amount of carbon dioxide in generating electricity under its license, that authority is limited to an amount which has reasonable regard and care for people and the environment. 

Macquarie appealed the courts finding that it was subject to implied CO2 emissions limits.  The implicit conditions were based on common law principles that require prevention of emissions in excess of levels that could be achieved by exercising reasonable regard and care for the interests of others and the environment. The court of appeals reversed the lower courts decision, reasoning that these common law principles only protected private rights (such as a nuisance claim) and were not applicable to a permit granted under a statute.",Decided on Appeal,['Australia>New South Wales>Court of Appeals'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],['Australia>Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW)'],Challenge court finding implied permit conditions limiting CO2 emissions,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/macquarie-generation-v-hodgson/

Wildlife Preservation Society of Queensland Proserpine/Whitsundry Branch Inc. v. Minister for the Environment and Heritage,"An Australian federal court upheld a federal agency decision to not require an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for a coal mine proposal under the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).  Environmental groups argued that the burning of coal harvested from the mines would contribute to global warming, which could have substantial adverse impacts on the ecosystems of world heritage areas like the Great Barrier Reef, triggering the EIA requirement under the EPBC Act.  The Court held that the greenhouse gas emissions from the mining and burning of coal had been considered by the agency in its decision not to require an environmental impact statement.  The judge was not persuaded that there is a casual link between coal mining activities and damage to ecosystems.

Xstrata Coal Queensland Pty. Ltd. and Others v. Friends of the Earth - Brisbane and Others,"Friends of the Earth and local land owners challenged mining leases granted under the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) for the development of a new mega coal mine in Queensland, Australia, as well as the draft conditions for an environmental authority to operate the mine which were proposed by the relevant Minister under the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld). While the claims made by landowners focused on the local impacts of the mine, such as potential water contamination and sound levels, Friends of the Earth argued that the lease and environmental authority should not be granted on the basis that the project will contribute to climate change and ocean acidification.  The proponent for the proposed mine, Xstrata Coal, argued that they were under no obligation to disclose the Scope 3 emissions of a project during the environmental impact assessment process. Scope 3 emissions include indirect GHG emissions which occur at sites away from the mine, such emissions from transporting the coal and from its end-use in electricity production.  Friends of the Earth argued that these scope 3 emissions must be considered when assessing the potential environmental impact of the mine.  The Court held that it could only consider the environmental impacts of the mine itself, and not of other activities such as the transport of coal or its end-use.  In addition, it held that while the direct GHG emissions of the mine may contribute to climate change, that this should not outweigh all other considerations in the assessment process for the mine, such as the potential economic benefit to the State of Queensland. The Court recommended that the approvals necessary for the mine be issued.

VZW Klimaatzaak v. Kingdom of Belgium &amp; Others,"Similar to the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, the Klimaatzaak -- ""climate case"" -- was brought by an organization of concerned citizens, and 58,000 citizen co-plaintiffs, arguing that Belgian law requires the Belgian government's approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be more aggressive. The suit named the Belgian State, the Walloon Region, the Flemish Region, and the Brussels-Capital Region as defendants. Specifically, plaintiffs called for reductions of 40% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 87.5% below 1990 levels by 2050.

From February 2019 through March 2020, the parties submitted their main conclusions and final conclusions. In their main conclusions, the plaintiffs seek a Court injunction directing the government to reduce emissions 42 to 48% in 2025 and at least 55 to 65% in 2030. Oral arguments were heard from March 16 to 26, 2021. 

On June 17, 2021, the Brussels Court of First Instance held that the Belgium government breached its duty of care by failing to take necessary measures to prevent the harmful effects of climate change, but declined to set specific reduction targets on separation of powers grounds. 

The Court first analyzed whether the claim was admissible, and, in doing so, whether the plaintiffs established that the proceedings would provide a benefit to them. Article 17 of the Judicial Code excludes actions brought in the general interest that only indirectly benefit the plaintiff. The Court found that both the 58,000 co-plaintiffs and the Klimaatzaak organization have a personal interest in the action. The citizen co-plaintiffs have a direct, personal interest because they seek to hold Belgian authorities responsible for the climate consequences on their daily lives, and the fact that other Belgian citizens may also suffer damages does not transform their interest into a general one. The Klimaatzaak organization has a direct, personal interest in part because environmental organizations have a privileged status to sue to defend the environmental from harm.

The Court found the federal state and the three regions jointly and individually in breach of their duty of care for failing to enact good climate governance. The Court found that despite being aware of the certain risk of dangerous climate change to the country's population, the authorities failed to take necessary action, meaning that they failed to act with prudence and diligence under Article 1382 of the Civil Code. Further, by failing to take sufficient climate action to protect the life and privacy of the plaintiffs, the defendants were in breach of their obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

However, the Court declined to issue an injunction ordering the government to set the specific emission reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs. The Court found that the separation of powers doctrine limited the Court's ability to set such targets, and doing so would contravene legislative or administrative authority. Neither European nor international law required the specific reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs, and that the scientific report that they relied on, while scientifically meritorious, was not legally binding. The specific targets, therefore, were a matter for the legislative and executive bodies to decide. 

On November 17, 2021, Klimaatzaak appealed the judgment of the Brussels Court of First Instance. The appeal is primarily aimed at the Tribunal's refusal to set specific binding targets related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over time. Klimaatzaak notably argues that the Brussels Court of First Instance has confused two distinct sources of liability in its analysis of Article 1382 of the Belgian Civil Code in that it confined itself to taking as a reference only the emission reduction targets laid down by rules of positive international, European and Belgian law, and refrained from analyzing the authorities' conduct in the light of their knowledge of the danger and of what needed to be done to help prevent or limit it. Klimaatzaak also asks the Court of Appeal to repeal and correct what they argue are factual or legal errors in the judgment of June 17, 2021. The defending Governments are expected to reply to this petition and the Brussels Court of Appeal will review the factual and the legal components of the case in the course of the appeal procedure.

After a written round of conclusions that will take sixteen months, the case will be heard from September 14 to October 6, 2023.",Pending,['Belgium>Brussels>Court of First Instance'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other']","['Belgium>Article 1382 of the Civil Code', 'European Convention on Human Rights', 'International Human Rights Law']",Compel federal and regional governments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/vzw-klimaatzaak-v-kingdom-of-belgium-et-al/

Neuzelle Agricultural Cooperative v. Head of Administrative Services of Oder-Spree rural district authority,"This case was a request for a preliminary ruling on two 2009 amendments to the agricultural rules in the Council Regulation that establish economic support schemes for farmers. The support scheme provided direct income support to farmers, however it was amended such that all direct payments beyond a certain amount should be reduced by a certain percentage each year.  The savings made through these reductions would then be used to finance measures under the rural development policy, in light of the new and demanding challenges faced by the agriculture sector, such as climate change and the increasing importance of bio-energy, as well as the need for better water management and more effective protection of biodiversity.  The Preamble also noted that Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the EU and its member states are called upon to adapt its policies in the light of climate change considerations.

The Court reviewed two issues: (1) whether a new provision to the Regulation to reduce the amount of direct payments to farmers was valid, against an existing provision that already set the amount, in light of the principle of protecting legitimate expectations; (2) and whether a four percent increase for farmers with larger holdings exceeding 300,000 euros violates the principle of non-discrimination.

Billerud Karlsborg AB v. Swedish Environmental Protection Agency,"The Swedish environmental protection agency, imposed penalties on the Billerud companies for failing to surrender credits under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in 2006. The Billerud companies challenged the penalties arguing that since the failure was due to an internal error and the companies had a sufficient number of allowances at the time, they should be excused. The European Court of Justice (CJEU) found that under Directive 2003/87/EZ, penalties for failure to surrender credits still apply even if the entity held a sufficient number of allowances at that time. In addition, the CJEU found that the penalty was a lump sum and may not be varied by a national court on the basis of the principle of proportionality.

"Borealis Polyolefine GmbH v. Minister for Land, Forestry, Environment, and Water Management","This European Court of Justice rejected arguments from three industrial firmsone German, one Dutch, and one Italianthat they should be granted a larger number of free greenhouse gas emissions allowances under the European Unions greenhouse gas Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS). The Court also instructed the European Commission to revise its approach to determining how many free allowances to granta step that has injected uncertainty into the markets built on the ETS. Several features of the ETS are critical to the case: 

- some allowances are auctioned to emitters and others are given away for free; 
- there are a fixed proportion of free allowances, which are granted only to firms that face competition from non-EU firmsa category that excludes electricity generators;
- the process for calculating the number of allowancesauctioned and freebegins with member states submission of emission sources and estimated volumes;
- responding to members states overestimation of the allowances due to their industrial firms, the European Commission issued Decisions in 2011 and 2013 to govern the calculation of a correction factor.

The Court found that the European Commissions 2013 Decision established a correction factor calculation that ignored relevant information, and on that basis instructed the Commission to revise its approach by March 2017. The Courts ruling largely ratified the November 2015 recommendation issued in the case by Advocate General Kokott, but deviated in one important respect: whereas Kokott had concluded that too many free allowances were granted to the firms, the ECJ determined that it was unclear whether too many or too few had been granted.

Germany v. Nordzucker AG,"Nordzucker AG (Nordzucker), a sugar refinery operator in Germany, produced an emissions report for 2005 pursuant to Directive 2003/87/EC,  part of the European Unions greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme. Nordzuckers emissions report excluded emissions resulting from steam generation necessary to operate the refinerys drying facility on the basis of a letter from a German Ministry stating that such facilities were exempted from compulsory emissions trading schemes. An expert verified the report, and Nordzucker surrendered emissions allowances equal to the emissions stated in the report. Subsequently, the German Emissions Trading Authority examined Nordzuckers emissions report and found that it should have included emissions attributable to the refinerys drying facility. Nordzucker revised its emissions report and surrendered additional allowances. German authorities found Nordzucker liable for failing to timely surrender emissions allowances and levied a penalty as provided in Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87. After a series of appeals, the German Federal Administrative Court referred to the European Court of Justice the question whether excess emissions penalties apply where an operator surrenders allowances equal to emissions stated in a verified report, but where the report is later found to understate the operators emissions and additional allowances are surrendered. The European Court of Justice found that such penalties should not apply and that, in such cases, national authorities should establish proportionate penalties taking into account relevant factual circumstances.

European Commission v. Council for the European Union,"Australia approached the European Commission (the Commission) to negotiate linking the EUs greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme with Australias emissions trading system. A formal recommendation authorizing the opening of negotiations with Australia was adopted by the Commission and forwarded to the Council for the EU (the Council). After Member States requested greater involvement in the negotiations with Australia, the Council approved negotiating directives which 1) required the Commission to report in writing to the Council on the outcome of the negotiations after each negotiating session and, in any event, at least quarterly and 2) laid out specific procedures for the negotiations, including allowing the Council or a special committee to establish detailed negotiating positions for the EU. The Commission brought an action to annul these sections of the negotiating directives on the basis that they exceeded the Councils authority and encroached on the Commissions power. The Advocate General issued an opinion finding that the Council is entitled to ask for regular reports on the negotiations process, but it may not unilaterally impose detailed procedures for the conduct of international negotiations. The Advocate General recommended that the Court annul the section of the negotiating directives requiring specific negotiating procedures. 

This separation of powers case arose from a decision of the EU Council relating to negotiations that the EU Commission would undertake with Australia regarding possible linkage of those jurisdictions emissions trading schemes. The Councils May 2013 decision set out procedures for the negotiation, detailed negotiating positions, and designated the Councils Working Party on the Environment to assist the Commission throughout the negotiation. The Commission challenged that decision on the grounds that it amounted to the Council assuming authority not granted by the controlling EU treaties, chiefly article 218(2)(4) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU. The EU Parliament and a number of member governments intervened in the casethe Parliament in support of the Commission, most of the national governments in support of the Council. The Court, acknowledging that this was a case of first impression but also the latest in a series of disputes over the scope of authority available to EU bodies, substantially agreed with the Commission and ordered the annulment of several portions of the Councils May 2013 decision, thereby giving the Commission a freer hand in conducting negotiations with Australia.",Partial annulment,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],"['European Union>Primary Law>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union>Article 13(2)', 'European Union>Primary Law>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union>Article 218(2) to (4)', 'European Union>Primary Law>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union>Article 295']",European Commission challenged negotiating directives of Council establishing detailed negotiating procedures and reporting requirements,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/european-commission-v-council-for-the-european-union/

Green Network SpA v. Italian Electric &amp; Gas Authority,"An Italian company, Green Network SpA (Green Network), imported renewable energy from a Swiss supplier in 2005. Under Italian law, energy companies were required to purchase a certain number of green certificates each year, but could seek an exemption where they imported renewable energy from countries with analogous laws promoting renewable energy. Where the exporting country was not a member of the European Union, the exemption was available only if there was a prior agreement between the importing and exporting countries regarding recognition of guarantees of origin. When Green Network requested an exemption from its obligation to purchase green certificates, the Italian national grid manager rejected that request since there was no agreement regarding guarantees of origin between Italy and Switzerland at the time the renewable energy was imported. Green Network brought an action in administrative court, which was dismissed. Green Network appealed the dismissal, and the appeals court referred to the European Court of Justice the question, inter alia, whether the Italian law conflicted with EU directives. The Court held that the Italian law was precluded since guarantees of origin fall within an area largely covered by EU law.

Opinion of Advocate General Sharpston (On request for preliminary ruling from Gerechtshof s-Hertogenbosch (Netherlands)),"Advocate General Sharpston was asked for guidance as to the meaning of the term dual use in the second indent of Article 2(4)(b) in relation to sugar production and lime fertilizer, the by-product arising from that process, of the Directive 2003/96/EC, which introduced a regime imposing minimum harmonized levels of taxation on all energy products and electricity. The referring court also asked whether national legislators are constrained by an EU concept of what constitutes dual use if they choose to introduce domestic measures in order to tax such energy products. 

The Advocate General answered that dual use within the meaning of Article 2(4)(b) refers to where coal is used as heating fuel in a lime-kiln in order to generate carbon dioxide for the production of lime-kiln gas, which is subsequently used for the purification of the raw juice obtained from sugar beets, that process giving rise to the by-product earth foam. The Advocate General found that Member States may apply a more restrictive definition of dual use and choose to tax dual use energy products, provided they exercise their competence consistently with EU law. If a Member State chooses to apply such a narrower definition, a taxpayer cannot invoke a broader EU concept of dual use in order to obtain exoneration from a charge to tax imposed under national law.

In support of the action, the Republic of Poland raised four pleas. The first alleged an infringement of the TFEU on the ground that the Commission did not take into account the specificity of each Member State in respect of fuel. The second plea concerned an alleged breach of the principle of equal treatment on the ground that the Commission did not take into account the difference in situation between the regions of the European Union. The third plea alleged a breach of the principle of proportionality. The fourth plea alleged that the Commission was not competent to adopt the contested decision.

A court of appeal in the Czech Republic requested a preliminary ruling from the European Court of Justice on the question of whether Article 10 precludes application of the Czech gift tax to emissions allowances obtained free of charge. The Court concluded that the gift tax was inconsistent with Article 10, because it undermined the directives objective to temporarily reduce the economic impact of the EU GHG emission allowances market. The Court directed to the referring court the question of whether the gift tax respect[s] the 10% ceiling on the allocation of emissions allowances.","Czech law precluded, case referred back to court of appeal",['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],['European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC'],Challenged imposition of a gift tax to GHG emissions allowances granted free of charge under EU law,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/sko-energo-sro-v-czech-appellate-financial-directorate/

U.S. Steel Kosice v. Commission of the European Communities (I and II),"In Case T-489/04 (U.S. Steel Kosice I), applicant U.S. Steel Kosice requested the annulment of a 2006 Commission decision on the Slovak NAP for Phase I of the EU ETS on the grounds that the Slovak Republic had been pressured by the Commission during allegedly non-transparent, bilateral negotiations into reducing the total number of allowances under the NAP.  The court dismissed the application as inadmissible, ruling that the reduction of the total quantity of allowance and the Commissions decision on the NAP did not individually affect the applicants interests.

In the second case, Case T-27/07 (U.S. Steel Kosice II), applicant sought annulment of the Commissions decision regarding the Slovak NAP for Phase II.  The court held that the action was inadmissible for the same reason above.  Applicant unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the European Court of Justice in Case C-6/08.

(B.U.N.D.) e.V. v.

The export credits in question provided financial support or guarantees for projects in the field of energy production. 

On March 2, 2006, the court proposed a settlement of the case without prejudice to the different opinions on the legal obligations and without setting a precedent. It also offered a legal opinion without precedent. The court rejected the Ministrys argument that information on German export credit activities did not constitute environmental information within the meaning of the UIG and could not potentially affect elements of the environment, such as climate change. The parties accepted the proposed settlement. The Ministry then committed to releasing comprehensive information on the climate change impacts of German export credits.

Miersch/Maxeiner v. Germany,"In August 2013, two journalists who had written various articles across different outlets questioning prevailing theories on climate change, brought suit in the Administrative Court of Halle. They requested the German Environment Agency (Umweltbundesamt) to cease and desist from publishing certain statements in a brochure, which referred to the journalists by name and identified them  amongst others  as climate-change sceptics. The journalists based their claim on a breach of their rights to privacy enshrined in Article 2 of the Basic Law (Germanys constitution).

In late November 2015, the court ruled that the federal privacy protection laws did not prevent the Agency from publishing the brochure. Although the court recognized the validity of the journalists rights to privacy in general, it concluded that they were not affected in the present case. The court also noted that the Environment Agency was not restricted to neutrality in its publications. To the contrary, the court stated that the Agencys task is to educate the public on environmental issues and to conduct scientific research, which necessarily presupposes that it  objectively  also deals with third party publications in an evaluative manner, to be able to inform the public about them.

The Court further considered that an EIA should be conducted prior to the implementation of the project. (para.205).

Bord Na Mona Allen Peat Limited and others engaged in peat extraction and transport were also parties to the case.  At issue was whether the approval granted to Edenderry had complied with the EUs Environmental Impact Assessment Directive, which was incorporated into Irish law in 2010. An Taisce argued that the approval had not because it had considered only the impacts of the plants operations but not those resulting from the peat extraction and transport involved in supplying the bulk of the plants feedstock. Edenderry and the other respondents countered that because neither the peat nor plant operations were contingent upon one another they were unrelated for the purposes of environmental review. The High Court, noting that it was required to base its decision on the actual reality of the project at issue, rejected Edenderrys arguments as theoreticalthe permit application, after all, contemplated sourcing from these particular bogs, such that any other approach would constitute a material change to the application.

Proponents of the project cite reduction in emission of harmful greenhouse gases and a national need for sustainable and renewable energy sources as support for the project.  The court determined that the purpose of the Resource Management Act 1991 would be better served by granting the wind farm proposal.  The court found that the benefit of the wind farm proposal, when seen in a national context, outweighed the site-specific effects and the effects on the surrounding area.

Greenpeace New Zealand Inc. v. Genesis Power Ltd.,"A power company proposed to build a power station fueled by natural gas. This required a number of resource consents, including a discharge permit. At question in this case was the proper interpretation of Section 104E of the Resource Management Act 1991. Section 104E prohibits consent authorities from considering the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change in discharge and coastal permit applications, except to the extent that the use and development of renewable energy enables a reduction in the discharge into air of greenhouse gases. A majority of the Supreme Court upheld the interpretation of the Appeals Court that this exception means that greenhouse gas emission reductions should only be considered in applications involving renewable energy. 

The decision rejects the interpretation of Section 104E made by a lower court in Greenpeace New Zealand v. Northland Regional Council which took the approach that a reduction in greenhouse gases through use of renewable energy could be considered in all applications for a discharge permit whether or not they proposed the use of renewable energy.

However, while the Tribunal acknowledged that climate change impacts may affect enjoyment of human rights, it explicitly declined to reach the question of whether climate change provided a basis for granting resident visas in this case.

"Ioane Teitiota v. The Chief Executive of the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment","A Kiribati citizen appealed the denial of refugee status in the New Zealand High Court. The appellant argued that the effects of climate change on Kirabati, namely rising ocean levels and environmental degradation, are forcing citizens off the island. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify the appellant for refugee status because the applicant was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. In addition to finding a lack of serious harm or serious violation of human rights were the appellant to return to Kirabati, the court also expressed concern about expanding the scope of the Refugee Convention and opening the door to millions of people who face hardship due to climate change.

The applicant appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. The applicant again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. The Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts conclusions, finding that the applicant did not qualify as a refugee under international human rights law.

Maniototo Environmental Society Inc. v. Central Otago District Council; Meridian Energy Ltd. v. Central Otago District Council and Others,"Applicants challenged the granting of resource consents to Meridian Energy for the construction of a wind farm using up to 176 wind turbines. The Environment Court of New Zealand conducted a cost-benefit analysis of the proposed wind farm and determined that the project did not comply with the Resource Management Act because the substantial adverse impacts on the natural landscape outweighed the positive factors, principally the large quantity of renewable energy. 

Meridian appealed the decision challenging the courts use of cost-benefit analysis and consideration of alternative sites. The High Court of New Zealand allowed the appeal and remanded the case back to the Environment Court. While the High Court found that the Environment Court was permitted to use cost benefit analysis, it instructed the court to allow Meridian to give further information on alternatives and opportunity to present a market-based analysis of impacts.

Thomson v. Minister for Climate Change Issues,"Sarah Thomson, a New Zealand law student, filed a Statement of Claim in 2015 against New Zealands Minister of Climate Change Issues alleging that the Minister had failed in several respects regarding the setting of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets required by New Zealands Climate Change Response Act of 2002. That Act implements New Zealands responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCCs Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealands intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a provisional target of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealands 1990 emission levels by 2030, and thus will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand.

The High Court of New Zealand issued its decision after the 2017 election had ousted the prior government, replacing it with a government whose members had campaigned on a commitment to eliminate all GHG emissions by 2050. Nonetheless, the court reviewed both the 2030 and 2050 targets set by the prior government's Minister and ruled on their legality. With respect to the 2050 target, the court determined that although the Minister had discretion under the 2002 act to review and determine New Zealand's emissions reduction target for 2050, that discretion was limited by the act's purpose and by the evidence contained in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), both of which argued strongly for a lower national emissions target than the one set based on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). However, because it was not clear that a review of the 2050 target in light of AR5 would certainly have led to the target's revision, and because the question was largely mooted by the recent election (""[s]uch a declaration would now be of historic interest only""), the court concluded merely that the Minister should have reviewed the target, but not that a decision to maintain the existing target after such a review would necessarily have been unlawful. With respect to the 2030 target in New Zealand's INDC and NDC, the court determined that it had authority to review the Minister's setting of that target but no grounds for invalidating it because the Minister had not made any reviewable error for which the Court may intervene. 

Regarding the authority of the courts to review climate change policy, the decision noted:

""It may be appropriate for domestic courts to play a role in Government decision making about climate change policy . . . The courts have not considered the entire subject matter is a no go area, whether because the state had entered into international obligations, or because the problem is a global one and one countrys efforts alone cannot prevent harm to that countrys people and their environment, or because the Governments response involves the weighing of social, economic and political factors, or because of the complexity of the science. The courts have recognised the significance of the issue for the planet and its inhabitants and that those within the courts jurisdiction are necessarily amongst all who are affected by inadequate efforts to respond to climate change. The various domestic courts have held they have a proper role to play in Government decision making on this topic, while emphasising that there are constitutional limits in how far that role may extend. The IPCC reports provide a factual basis on which decisions can be made. Remedies are fashioned to ensure appropriate action is taken while leaving the policy choices about the content of that action to the appropriate state body.""

Gbemre v. Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria Ltd. and Others,"The applicant, Gbemre, a representative of the Niger Delta Iwherekan community instituted an action against (i) the Nigerian government for its failure to stop the oil and gas company Shell in gas flaring for decades and (ii) Shell for engaging in massive and unceasingly intense gas flaring in the community, in the course of its exploration and production activities (jointly respondents). The applicant argues that Shell failed to consider the environmental impact of its activities on the communities means of livelihood, collective survival, as well as the gas flarings contribution to the adverse and potentially life-threatening effects of climate change. The applicant claimed that such gas flaring activities violated the communitys rights to life and human dignity as constitutionally guaranteed by sections 33 and 34 of the 1999 Nigerian Constitution, and reinforced by Articles 4, 16, and 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights (ratified and domesticated by Nigeria as Cap. A9, Laws of the Federation of Nigeria, 2004).

The Federal Hight Court held that these constitutionally guaranteed rights inevitably include the rights to a clean, poison and pollution free environment. The federal Judge ruled that the actions of the respondents in allowing and continuing to flare gas in the applicants community is a violation of their fundamental rights to a clean and healthy environment. The judge further ruled that Shells failure to carry out an EIA is a clear violation of the EIA Act and a violation of said rights. The Judges ordered them to take immediate steps to stop gas flaring. The Judge further ordered the Attorney General of Nigeria to ensure speedy amendment of the Associated Gas Re-injection Act to be in line with Nigerias human rights obligations under both the Constitution and the African Charter.

Non-compliance Procedure of Greece Under The Kyoto Protocol,"The case arose with respect to Greeces failure to establish an initial report to facilitate the calculation of the Kyoto Protocols Parties assigned amount and to demonstrate its capacity to account for emissions and the assigned amount (Kyoto Protocol, article 5(1)). In particular, the maintenance of the institutional and procedural arrangements, the arrangements for the technical competence of relevant staff, and the capacity for timely performance of the Greek national system appeared as unresolved problems. On 17 April 2008, the enforcement branch thus determined that Greece was not in compliance with the guidelines for national systems and therefore not eligible to participate in the emission trading mechanisms under articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Protocol. In July and October 2008, Greece submitted revised reports and plans. On 13 November 2008, the branch decided that there no longer continued to be a question of implementation with respect to Greece's eligibility, and that Greece was fully eligible to participate in the mechanisms under articles 6, 12 and 17 of the Protocol.

Ali v. Federation of Pakistan,"Rabab Ali, a 7-year-old girl who lives in Karachi, is the named petitioner in a challenge to various actions and inactions on the part of Pakistans federal government and on the part of the Province of Sindh (where Karachi is located). The Petition, filed directly with the countrys Supreme Court, alleges violations of constitutionally protected fundamental rights, of the Public Trust Doctrine as it relates to Pakistans atmosphere and climate, and of rights relating to the environmental degradation expected to result from burning coal to generate electricity. In support of these allegations, it highlights that Pakistans government has acknowledged the reality and consequences of climate change with the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy of 2013. 

Ali maintained that exploiting the coalfields would further destabilize the climate system and infringe citizens constitutional rights to life, liberty, dignity, information, equal protection before the law, among others. The right to life, she argued, included an inalienable right to a stable climate system void of dangerous levels of CO2. Ali noted that Pakistan committed to and was bound by the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement. While she acknowledged that Pakistan could not solve climate change alone, she said that it must do its fair share to keep atmospheric CO2 concentrations within the safe level. 

While the Petition alleges a variety of specific acts or omissions by Pakistans government, its chief focus is on the approval of a plan to develop coal fields located in the Thar desert region, located in the southeast corner of the country. That development is anticipated to increase Pakistani coal production from 4.5 to 60 million metric tons per year, with a commensurate increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiff argued that exploitation of the Thar coalfields would release approximately 327 billion tons of CO2, more than 1,000 times Pakistans previous estimate for annual GHG emissions. Coal mining in the Thar Desert would also worsen air pollution, impact water quality.  It is also expected to displace residents in that region, and to lead to environmental degradation both directly (through water quality impacts) and indirectly (through air quality impacts from coal combustion). She claimed that thousands of Thari people were driven from their land in violation of their right to property, dignity, and equal protection before the law. The petition argued that Pakistan could potentially use renewable energy to power all of its energy needs, including in the transport, industrial, and agriculture sectors. Ali also sought protection for mangroves for sequestering carbon and protecting against sea level rise. As the Petition notes, the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor is the source of investments of $1.2 billion for both coal field development and for the development of multiple coal-fired power plants in Pakistan.

Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan,"Ashgar Leghari, a Pakistani farmer sued the national government for failure to carry out the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy (2014-2030). Leghari argued that the government should pursue climate mitigation or adaptation efforts, and that the governments failure to meet its climate change adaptation targets had resulted in immediate impacts on Pakistans water, food, and energy security. Such impacts offended his fundamental right to life.

On September 4, 2015, an appellate court in Pakistan granted the Leghari's claims, describing climate change as a defining challenge of our time. Citing domestic and international legal principles, the court determined that ""the delay and lethargy of the State in implementing the Framework offend the fundamental rights of the citizens."" The court reasoned that the constitutional rights to life and human dignity (under articles 9 and 14 of the constitution) included the right to a healthy and clean environment. Further, interpretation of these fundamental rights must be guided by (i) the constitutional values of democracy, equality, and social, economic, and political justice; and (ii) international environmental principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, intergenerational and intragenerational equity, and the doctrine of public trust.

Although the government had formulated a climate change policy and implementation framework, the court concluded there had been no real progress with implementation. To oversee the execution of the policy, the court (i) directed several government ministries to each nominate ""a climate change focal person"" to help ensure the implementation of the Framework, and to present a list of action points by December 31, 2015; and (ii) created a Climate Change Commission composed of representatives of key ministries, NGOs, and technical experts to monitor the government's progress. On September 14, 2015, the court issued a supplemental decision naming 21 individuals to the Commission and vesting it with various powers. 

On January 25, 2018, the court took note of the submission of a report from the Climate Change Committee noting that during the period from September 2015 to January 2017 66% of the priority actions from the Framework for Implementation Climate Change Policy have been implemented. After dissolving the commission, the court constituted a standing committee, creating an ongoing link between the court and the executive. 

In its final order, the court nominated climate justice as the successor to environmental justice. Environmental justicesaid the courtrevolved around enforcing national laws, with decisions informed by international legal principles. It focused on shifting or stopping pollutive industries. Climate justice, as the court envisioned it, adopted a human-centered approach. It linked human rights with development. It sought to safeguard the rights of vulnerable peoples and share the burdens and benefits of climate change and its impacts equitably and fairly. Climate justice was informed by science, responds to science and acknowledges the need for
equitable stewardship of the worlds resources. However, realizing that climate justice was challenging, the court acknowledged that polluters often fell beyond national borders and were difficult to identify. Finally, the court outlined its vision for water justice as a human right to access clean water and a sub-concept of climate justice.

In re Greenpeace Southeast Asia and Others,"Greenpeace Southeast Asia and numerous other organizations and individuals filed a petition asking the Commission to investigate a general issuethe human rights implications of climate change and ocean acidification and the resulting rights violations in the Philippinesand a more specific onewhether the investor-owned Carbon Majors have breached their responsibilities to respect the rights of the Filipino people. The core factual allegation of the petition draws on research identifying particular entities quantum of responsibility for anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions since 1751. The original petition names 50 of those entities, all publicly traded corporations, as respondents. It identifies multiple sources of human rights, but draws most heavily on the UN Human Rights Commissions Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

During a conference held on December 11, 2017, the Commission accepted the petition and confirmed that they would investigate the potential human rights violations stemming from major fossil fuel companies contributions to climate change. The Commission announced it would hold fact-finding missions and public hearings in 2018. In March 2018, the Commission held its first public hearings to investigate the alleged responsibility of major fossil fuel companies or  carbon majors for climate change and the potential impacts on the human rights of Filipinos.

On December 9, 2019, the Commission announced its finding that major fossil fuel companies could be held liable for climate change impacts. According to news reports, the Commission concluded that legal responsibility for climate damage is not covered by current international human rights law, but fossil fuel companies have a clear moral responsibility, and the onus falls on individual countries to pass strong legislation and establish legal liability in their courts. The Commission further found that that existing civil law in the Philippines provided grounds for action, and it may also be possible to hold companies criminally accountable where they have been clearly proved to have engaged in acts of obstruction and willful obfuscation. The Commission also concluded that major fossil fuel companies have an obligation to respect human rights as articulated by the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights.

On May 6, 2022, the Commission on Human Rights of the Philippines (CHR) issued the final report of its multi-year investigation into 47 investor-owned corporations for human rights harms that result from their actions triggering climate change. Major findings in the report include:

1. Carbon Majors products contributed to 21.4% of global emissions (p. 99). The Carbon Majors had early awareness, notice, or knowledge of their products adverse impacts on the environment and climate system, at the latest, in 1965. (pp. 101-104)

2. Carbon Majors, directly by themselves or indirectly through others, singly and/or through concerted action, engaged in willful obfuscation of climate science, which has prejudiced the right of the public to make informed decisions about their products, concealing that their products posed significant harms to the environment and the climate system. (pp. 108-109)

3. In addition to liability anchored on acts of obfuscation of climate science, fossil-based companies may also be held to account by their shareholders for continued investments in oil explorations for largely speculative purposes. (p. 109)

4. All acts to obfuscate climate science and delay, derail, or obstruct this transition may be a basis for liability. At the very least, they are immoral (p. 115). Climate change denial and efforts to delay the global transition from fossil fuel dependence still persists. Obstructionist efforts are driven, not by ignorance, but by greed. Fossil fuel enterprises continue to fund the electoral campaigns of politicians, with the intention of slowing down the global movement towards clean, renewable energy. (p. 110)

5. The Carbon Majors have the corporate responsibility to undertake human rights due diligence and provide remediation (p. 110). Business enterprises, including their value chains, doing business in, or by some other reason within the jurisdiction of, the Philippines, may be compelled to undertake human rights due diligence and held accountable for failure to remediate human rights abuses arising from their business operations (pp. 113-114).",Decided,['Philippines>Commission on Human Rights'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']",['Philippines>Filipino Constitution of 1987'],Investigation into allegation that largest emitters have violated human rights of Filipinos by causing climate change and ocean acidification,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/in-re-greenpeace-southeast-asia-et-al/

Urgenda Foundation v. State of the Netherlands,"A Dutch environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation, and 900 Dutch citizens sued the Dutch government to require it to do more to prevent global climate change. The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the governments existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17% insufficient to meet the states fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring. In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the no harm principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures. This is the first decision by any court in the world ordering states to limit greenhouse gas emissions for reasons other than statutory mandates. 

The Dutch government submitted 29 grounds of appeal. Urgenda submitted a cross-appeal, contesting the courts decision that Urgenda cannot directly invoke Articles 2 & 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in these proceedings.

On Oct 9, 2018, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld the District Court's ruling, concluding that by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  by  at least 25% by end-2020, the Dutch government is acting unlawfully in contravention of its duty of care under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. The court recognized Urgendas claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence. The court determined that the Dutch government has an obligation under the ECHR to protect these rights from the real threat of climate change. The court rejected the governments argument that the lower court decision constitutes an order to create legislation or violation of trias politica and the role of courts under the Dutch constitution. In response to these appeals, the court affirmed its obligation to apply provisions with direct effect of treaties to which the Netherlands is party, including Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. Further, the court found nothing in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that prohibits a member state from taking more ambitious climate action than the E.U. as a whole, nor that adaptation measures can compensate for the governments duty of care to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, nor that the global nature of the problem excuses the Dutch government from action.

The Dutch government appealed the decision, and the Netherlands' Supreme Court heard the appeal on May 24, 2019. On September 13 the Advocate and Procurator General, independent judicial officers, issued a formal opinion recommending that the Supreme Court uphold the decision.

On December 20, 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the decision under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR.

Environment-People-Law v. Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine and National Agency of Environmental Investments,"In October 2009, the Ukrainian public interest organization Environment-People-Law (EPL) filed suit against the government, seeking to compel the dissemination of information on international greenhouse gas emissions trading.  EPL specifically sought information regarding an agreement between Ukraine and Japan, where the Japanese government agreed to buy 30 million tons of carbon offsets from the Ukrainian government.  EPL contended that both the Aarhus Convention and the Constitution of Ukraine compels public access to the information.

On June 17, 2010, the Lviv Administrative Court ruled in part for the plaintiffs and in part for the defendants. According to the plaintiffs, the court ruled that the Cabinet of Ministers and the National Agency of Environmental Investments had acted unlawfully by failing to provide plaintiffs with information on international GHG emissions trading and ordered the defendants to provide such information. However, the court dismissed the plaintiff EPL's request for information on the price of GHG emission quotas as part of the emissions trading with Japan. EPL appealed this part of the decision.

As a result of a fraudulent sale to Winnington of EUAs belonging to Armstrong, it was necessary to determine, among other things, their status under law.  To determine the status of EUAs, the Court applied a three-part test identified in Re Celtic Extraction.  In order for EUAs to be considered property, there must be statutory framework conferring an entitlement on their holder to an exemption from a fine, the property must be transferable under a statutory framework, and the property must have value.  The Court classified EUAs as intangible property at common law, as they satisfy the three prongs of the test, and determined that since EUAs may be subject to restitutionary claims, Armstrong was entitled to a money judgment.",EU Allowances classified as intangible property,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],['United Kingdom>EU Emissions Trading Scheme'],Determine legal status of EU Allowances (EUAs) under English law,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/armstrong-dlw-gmbh-v-winnington-networks-ltd/

Greenpeace v. Secretary of State for Trade and Industry,"The Judgment relates to a 12-month consultation process announced in November 2005 by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry regarding the Governments review of its policy with respect to nuclear power stations. Greenpeace was among the parties that made submissions during the consultation. Despite many submissions against nuclear energy, the Secretary of State published a report in July 2006 announcing that the Government was favorable to the construction of new nuclear plants in the country. Greenpeace challenged that decision arguing that the consultation process had been flawed. Agreeing with Greenpeaces allegations, the High Court declared the consultation process to have been very seriously flawed (para. 116). Notably, the Court reminded the Secretary of State that the Government had signed and ratified the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters and was thus bound by international law to provide full public consultation. Among other shortfalls, the Court highlighted that insufficient information was given to consultees, that the consultation document was seriously misleading, and that the consultation period was insufficient. Nevertheless, the Court held that the better outcome in the case was to grant declaratory relief, rather than a quashing order as asked by Greenpeace.

R. (on the application of Swiss International Airlines AG) v. Secretary of State for Climate Change and Energy,"The European Union temporarily suspended the greenhouse gas emissions allowance trading scheme for flights coming in and out of the EU, for the purpose of encouraging an agreement among members of the International Civil Aviation Organization to regulate aviation emissions. Flights between EU countries and Switzerland, however, were excluded from the suspension. Swiss International Airlines AG (Swissair) sued, claiming that the EU decision was invalid because it breached the principle of equal treatment. A lower court found that the principle of equal treatment did not apply to differential treatment by the EU towards non-EU member states such as Switzerland, and that, even if the principle did apply, it had not been breached in this case. On appeal, the court found that sufficient doubt existed as to the scope of the equal treatment principle and its application in this case to justify a referral to the European Union Court of Justice, the only court with jurisdiction to declare an EU law invalid.

"Association of Swiss Senior Women for Climate Protection v. Federal Department of the Environment Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC) and Others","In 2016, a group of senior women, filed suit against the Federal Council, the Federal Department of the Environment Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), The Federal Office for the Environment, and the Federal Office for Energy, , alleging that these bodies of the Swiss Government had failed to uphold obligations under the Swiss Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) by not steering Switzerland onto an emissions reduction trajectory consistent with the goal of keeping global temperatures well below 2oC above pre-industrial levels. Specifically, petitioners alleged the government had violated articles 10 (right to life), 73 (sustainability principle), and 74 (environmental protection) of the Swiss Constitution and by articles 2 and 8 ECHR. The petitioners alleged that their demographic group is especially vulnerable to the heat waves expected to result from climate change. They called upon the Swiss parliament and the relevant federal agencies to develop a regulatory approach to several sectors that would achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The petition criticized both the targets under discussion at the time in parliament (20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030) and the measures by which the Government would pursue those targets.

The petition was dismissed by DETEC on 25 April 2017. DETEC found that petitioners lacked standing because their rights were not affected as required by Article 25a (1) APA (Administrative Procedure Act, Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz,VwVG). DETEC determined that petitioners sought regulation of global CO2 emissions through general regulations rather than seeking a remedy for an infringement of their specific legal rights. DETEC further found that petitioners did not have victim status under the ECHR because they sought an injunction to serve the wider public interest of adoption of legislative reform to reduce CO2 emissions. Petitioners appealed the dismissal on May 26, 2017.

On November 27, 2018, the Swiss Federal Administrative Court rejected the appeal holding that Swiss women over 75 years of age are not exclusively affected by climate change impacts (thus echoing DETECs determination that the injury and remedy were not specialized to claimants). In January 2019, the claimants lodged an appeal against the judgment with Swiss Supreme Court. On May 20, 2020, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The Court held that the plaintiffs' asserted rights had not been affected with sufficient intensity, and that the remedy they seek must be achieved through political rather than legal means.

On November 26, 2020, having exhausted all available legal remedies in Switzerland, the claimants filed an application to the European Court of Human Rights.

"Decision C-035/16 of February 8, 2016","Colombias Constitutional Court struck down provisions of Law No. 1450 of 2011 and of Law No. 1753 of 2015 that threatened high-altitude ecosystems, called paramos. The court noted several important features of paramos, including their fragility, their lack of regulatory protection, their role in providing Colombia with as much as 70 percent of its drinking water, and the capacity of their soils and vegetation to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The court highlighted the last of these features in particular, calling paramos a carbon capture system and explaining that a paramos carbon capture capacity exceeds that of a comparably-sized tropical rainforest. 

Law No. 1450 of 2011 established Colombias National Development Plan 20102014, and Law No. 1753 of 2015 established its 20142018 successor. Two provisions in the latter law are especially notable here. The first of these authorizes the Commission on Intersectoral Infrastructure and Strategic Projects to designate particular projects as being in the national strategic interesta designation that exempts projects from aspects of local regulatory oversight. The second provision prohibits various activitiesagriculture, mining, oil and gas exploration and refiningin paramos, but only if project owners received a lease and environmental permit for mining after February 9, 2010 or for oil and gas operations after June 16, 2011. Thus the law authorizes projects that received permits prior to those dates. 

The Court declared both of these provisions (and others) unconstitutional for, among other things, endangering the publics right to clean water, and relieving government agencies of their obligation to justify decisions certain to result in the degradation of environmentally sensitive and valuable areas.

Greenpeace Nordic Assn v. Ministry of Petroleum and Energy (People v Arctic Oil),"A coalition of environmental groups sought a declaratory judgment from the Oslo District Court that Norways Ministry of Petroleum and Energy violated the Norwegian constitution by issuing a block of oil and gas licenses for deep-sea extraction from sites in the Barents Sea. Their petition highlighted several key factual points: 

 -- the licenses would allow access to as-yet undeveloped fossil fuel deposits, and such development is inconsistent with the climate change mitigation required to avert global warming of 1.5C and possibly even 2C in excess of pre-industrial levels;
 -- the area made accessible by the licenses would be the northernmost yet developed, and would abut the ice zonethus rigs and tankers would be exposed to unprecedented risks of damage and spills, and their operation would deliver emissions of black carbon to the highly sensitive arctic; and
 -- the Norwegian government will incur costs to develop the sites, and will only recoup those costs if the oil and gas they produce commands and adequately high market price. 

It situated these points in a legal context shaped most fundamentally by article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which establishes a right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained. Other constitutional provisions cited in the petition as relevant to the licensing decision included those requiring government action to be consistent with: the precautionary principle; the no harm principle as it applies both domestically and to citizens of other countries; and human rights protections. The petition was filed by Young Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, together with the Grandparents Climate Campaign and Friends of the Earth Norway. 

The Oslo District Court ruled in favor of the Norwegian Government on January 4, 2018. The court recognized that Article 112 of the Constitution is a rights provision, but found that the government did not violate any relevant rights because it had fulfilled the necessary duties before making the licensing decision. The court also declared that, [e]missions of CO2 abroad from oil and gas exported from Norway are irrelevant when assessing whether the Decision entails a violation of Article 112. In its assessment of whether the government had fulfilled its duties in regard to traditional environmental harm or other climate effects, the court noted that the Storting, (the Norwegian Parliament), had broadly agreed to open the southeast Barents Sea to licensing and had considered proposals to halt that licensing or review whether it was inappropriate in light of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the courts decision, the involvement of the Storting could be found in itself sufficient to indicate that the duty to take measures had been fulfilled. 
 	
Greenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth appealed the decision to the Bogarting Court of Appeal. Appellants allege that [t]he District Court erred in interpreting Article 112 in such a way that it limits the duty of the Norwegian government to guarantee the right to a healthy environment. They argue that the court interpreted Article 112 too restrictively in reaching the determination that Norway is only responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions released within Norwegian territory.

On January 22, 2020, the Borgarting Court of Appeal affirmed the District Court's decision ruling that the oil and gas licenses are valid. The appellate court parted company with the District Court in holding that article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution applies to the environmental damages alleged, including emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of oil and gas after export, and that emissions resulting from the relevant decision cannot be considered in isolation. However, the Court of Appeal held that the threshold for a violation of article 112 is high, and courts should exercise restraint in reviewing decisions by the political branches. The Court held that the appellants could not show a violation of article 112 in this instance, particularly because it is uncertain whether and to what extent to the licenses will lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs appealed the decision on February 24, 2020. The Norwegian Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on April 20. 

On December 22, 2020, the Supreme Court announced its decision rejecting the appeal and upholding the licenses for deep-sea extraction. Eleven of the 15 judge panel upheld the lower court's ruling. The Court reasoned that although the Norwegian constitution protects citizens from environmental and climate harms, the future emissions from exported oil are too uncertain to bar the granting of these petroleum exploration licenses.

Luciano Lliuya v. RWE AG,"In November 2015, Saul Luciano Lliuya, a Peruvian farmer who lives in Huaraz, Peru, filed claims for declaratory judgment and damages in the District Court Essen, Germany against RWE, Germanys largest electricity producer. Luciano Lliuyas suit, supported by NGO Germanwatch, alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz. Especially, as the melting gave rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has dramatically accelerated from 2003 onwards. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance due to which plaintiff had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur from setting up flood protections. The share calculated amounted to 0.47% of the total cost - the same percentage as RWEs estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialization (from 1751 onwards).

The district court dismissed Luciano Lliuyas requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his request for damages. The court noted that it could not provide Luciano Lliuya with effective redress (Luciano Lliuya's situation would not change, the court held, even if RWE ceased emitting), and that no linear causal chain could be discerned amid the complex components of the causal relationship between particular greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts.

On November 30, 2017, the appeals court  the Higher Regional Court of Hamm  recognized the complaint as well-pled and admissible, allowing the case to move into the evidentiary phase. Here, it will be determined whether Luciano Lliuyas home is: (a) threatened by flooding or mudslides as a result of the recent increase in the volume of the glacial lake located nearby, and (b) how RWEs greenhouse gas emissions contribute to that risk. The appeals court will review expert opinion on RWEs CO2 emissions, the contribution of those emissions to climate change, the resulting impact on the Palcaraju Glacier, and RWEs contributory share of responsibility for causing the resulting effects. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the on-site visit has had to be postponed several times and has yet to take place. While the facts of this case must still be adjudicated, the courts recognition that a private company could potentially be held liable for the climate change related damages of its greenhouse gas emissions marks a significant development in law.

After a long delay, especially due to the coronavirus pandemic, a site visit took place in the Andean city of Huaraz in May 2022. Judges of the Higher Regional Court (OLG) of Hamm (Germany), court-appointed experts and lawyers for both parties travelled to Peru to examine whether the plaintiff's house is threatened by a possible flood wave from the glacier lake Palcacocha above the city. The court-appointed experts will now write an expert report and submit it to the court.

"PUSH Sweden, Nature and Youth Sweden and Others v. Government of Sweden","Vattenfall, an energy firm in which the Swedish government owns a controlling stake, agreed to sell several coal-fired power plants and associated mining assets to the German subsidiary of a Czech holding company. The sale was prompted in part by an environmental review that recommended Swedish divestment from fossil assets. Environmental NGOs and individual plaintiffs challenged the sale as a violation of the Swedish governments duty of care to its citizens to protect their right to a non-harmful climate. The plaintiffs petition grounds this duty in the Swedish Constitution and Swedens adoption of several international agreementsthe petition thus resembles submission made in the recent Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The petition argued that the sale would enable the expanded exploitation of lignite coal assets, resulting in emissions in excess of limits that correspond to climate stability. It further noted that Sweden committed to act to avoid breaching those limits. On this basis, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that 1) the Swedish state has breached its duty of care with the sale, and 2) the sale is illegal. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order publication of the environmental review conducted in advance of the sale, which the government has so far withheld.

Ralph Lauren 57 v. Byron Shire Council,"A group of plaintiffs who own property along Belongil Beach in New South Wales, Australia sought damages from the local government authority, the Byron Shire Council, to cover the costs of erecting shoreline protections on their parcels and to compensate for lost value to their properties from encroaching seas. Plaintiffs alleged that the need for those protections and the cause of the properties partial loss of value was the fault of the Council. In the 1960s and 70s, the Council constructed a form of hard shoreline armoringan artificial headland protected by a rock seawall. Then, between 2006 and 2010, the Council issued draft planning documents (i) prohibiting the plaintiffs from armoring their own segments of shoreline and (ii) proposing a policy of managed retreat in response to rising seas and an encroaching shoreline. The Coastal Protection Act provides that such plans only become final and effective after approval by the New South Wales Minister for Planning; the Council withdrew its draft Coastal Zone Management Plan in May 2011, before the Minister considered it. 

Plaintiffs presented two alternative theories in support of their claim: either that the Council was negligent for installing hard shoreline armoring that has since displaced wave action to plaintiffs adjacent portions of beach, worsening erosion there; or that the councils armoring constitutes an instance of public nuisance. Plaintiffs also argued that their injury was compounded by the Councils issuance and withdrawal of planning documents, and persistent position that managed retreat is the preferred policy response to shoreline encroachment.

After the plaintiffs suit survived a motion to dismiss in March 2016, the Councils insurers, who had been steering the defense in the case, agreed to a settlement. As a result, the court never determined legal liability for the claims alleged. The settlements terms bar the Council from removing existing coastal armoring (chiefly rock, concrete, and rubble barriers) on the plaintiffs parcels unless the plaintiffs agree to such removal. Should plaintiffs want to add to that armoring, the must apply within one year of the settlement, dated August 2016, and then must make the requested additions within one year of approval of their application. Any subsequent repairs or additions may only be proposed after 20 years, and the Council has not guaranteed that such proposals would be approved.",Decided ,"['Australia>New South Wales>Supreme Court of New South Wales, Common Law Division']",['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Climate adaptation'],['Australia>Coastal Protection Act of 1979'],Whether the local government was liable to property owners for costs of erecting shoreline protections on their land and for compensation for lost value to their properties through coastal erosion.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ralph-lauren-57-v-byron-shire-council/
In re Vienna-Schwechat Airport Expansion,"Various NGOs and individuals persuaded a panel of the Austrian Federal Administrative Court to overturn the government of Lower Austrias approval of construction of a third runway at Viennas main airport. The reason: authorizing the runway would do more harm to the public interest than good, primarily because it would be contrary to Austrias national and international obligations to mitigate the causes of climate change. Of the authorities cited by the court, the most important was Austrias Climate Protection Act of 2011, which set emissions reduction targets for various sectors, including the transport sector. Because a third runway was expected to increase Austrias annual CO2 emissions, the court concluded that it would be at odds with the provisions of the 2011 Act as well as with Austrias constitution and its international commitments under EU law and the Paris Agreement.

The Austrian Constitutional Court overturned the Federal Administrative Courts decision in June 2017, citing multiple errors that led the lower court to improperly give weight to climate change and land use considerations in the balancing test it used to consider the publics interest in a third runway. The errors identified by the Constitutional Court included:
- misconstruing the Air Traffic Laws instruction to consider environmental protection over-broadly by factoring in environmental impacts beyond those directly attributable to air traffic;
- wrongly including in emissions projections aircraft emissions attributable to flight segments other than landing and takeoff;
- improperly superimposing regional greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets on an analysis of legal rights and obligations under the federal Air Traffic Law; and
- misapplication of the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement, which the Constitutional Court explained are the source of international obligations for Austria but are not generally applicable in the domestic legal context (""sie erzeugen daher nur eine volkerrechtliche Verpflichtung Osterreichs und sind innerstaatlich nicht unmittelbar anwendbar"").

Turp v. Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada,"Daniel Turp sought judicial review of Canadas decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. He alleged that the Conservative-led Government could not do without some form of authorization from Parliament. Underlying this dispute and Canadas ambivalent commitment to Kyoto was the fact that Canada was led from 2004 to 2015 by Governments elected with either a razor-thin majority of seats or reliant for their majority position on a coalition of parties. Canada had signed the Kyoto Protocol in 1998 and ratified it in 2002. A Conservative Government entered into power in 2006, shortly after the Protocol entered into effect in 2005. When that Government made clear that it would not pursue greenhouse gas emissions reductions adequate to comply with Kyoto, a member of parliament proposed a private billi.e., proposed legislation not put forward by the governmentrequiring compliance with the Protocol, which became known as the Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act (KPIA). About a month after Canada gave notice of its withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol in December 2011, the applicant, Turp, sought judicial review of that decision. Between his filing and issuance of the courts opinion, Parliament repealed the KPIA.

Nonetheless, the court considered Turps legal arguments, and explained its rejection of each of them. Contrary to Turps contention that withdrawal from Kyoto violated the law and threatened the separation of powers, the court concluded that the Governments discretion (Royal Prerogative) was not curtailed or foreclosed by the KPIAindeed, the court pointed out, the KPIA describes itself as requiring the Government to operate under the Kyoto Protocol, which itself provides expressly that a government may withdraw. Contrary to Turps contention that the democratic principle prohibited withdrawal unless Parliament had authorized it, the court noted that the House of Commons only ever passed a motion encouraging ratification of the Protocol, and so did not thereby draw a line that withdrawal would cross.",Decided,['Canada>Federal Court'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Kyoto Protocol'],"['Canada>Kyoto Protocol Implementation Act, 2007']",Challenge Canadian Government's withdrawal from Kyoto Protocol,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/turp-v-minister-of-justice-and-attorney-general-of-canada/
EarthLife Africa Johannesburg v. Minister of Environmental Affairs and Others,"South Africa's High Court was asked to determine whether, under the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998, ""relevant"" considerations for environmental review of plans for a new 1200 MW coal-fired Thabametsi Power Project include the projects impacts on the global climate and the impacts of a changing climate on the project. Notably, the project would operate until about 2060. The court, after observing that the statute does not expressly contemplate climate change, held that such considerations are relevant and that their absence from the environmental review of the project made its approval unlawful. This question came before the court as a result of EarthLife Africa Johannesburg's appeals. The first appeal was submitted to the Minister of Environmental Affairs to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental review; EarthLife argued that the review was invalid because it largely ignored climate change. The second was submitted to the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the Minister's mealy-mouthed determination that the review was legally valid even though it would have to be supplemented by a climate change analysis because issues related to climate mitigation and adaptation had not ""comprehensively assessed and/or considered.""

The court cited several reasons, including South Africas commitments under the Paris Agreement, for its conclusion that climate change is indeed a relevant consideration for the environmental review of the Thabametsi Project. Because the review approved by the minister effectively ignored climate change, the court held it to be legally invalid. 

After the decision of the High Court, the Minister of Environmental Affairs reconsidered the permit application in light of a newly finalized climate change impact assessment and again approved of the environmental authorization for the plant on January 30, 2018. The Minister reasoned that while the power plant would have significant GHG emissions and therefore cause climate change impacts, the power generation benefits of the project outweighed the harms. 

On March 26, 2018, EarthLife Africa and Trustees for the Time Being of the Groundwork Trust challenged the Minister's decision, asking the court to set aside the decision as unlawful for failing to consider site-specific climate change impacts associated with the project.

On November 19, 2020, the High Court, pursuant to an agreement between applicants and defendants, issued an order setting aside all governmental authorizations for the coal-fired power plant. The Court also ordered the defendants to pay court costs.

R. v. Dosanjh,"The defendants were involved in manipulation of the EU Emissions Trade Scheme, running companies that formed two artificial trading chains through which the fraud was operated. They were convicted of the common law offense of conspiring to cheat the public revenue and sentenced to terms of imprisonment of 15 years, 11 years and 9 years, respectively. The defendants appealed the sentences, arguing that (1) it was wrong in principle to pass a sentence which was longer than the maximum penalty available for the equivalent statutory offenses or for the cognate common law offense of conspiracy to defraud; and (2) the sentence of 15 years was, on the facts of the case, manifestly excessive. 

The court stated that Parliament had deliberately not decided the offense of cheating the revenue. Parliament had left the offense of conspiracy to cheat the public revenue from statutory charge, both in existence and the penalty at large, because it is of particular seriousness. In assessing whether or not the sentences were manifestly excessive, the court looked at previous decisions of the court and the draft guideline from the Sentencing Council, and noted that: cheating the revenue is a major drain on the public purse, and the defendants actions were a serious level of offending, with an enormous amount of planning. However, the court determined that those sentences were too high and reduced the sentences to 13 years, 10 years and 8 years.",Sentences reduced,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>Court of Appeal>Court of Appeal (Civil Division)'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects'],['European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC'],Challenging criminal sentence for cheating the EU ETS,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/regina-v-dosanjh/

Essent Belgium NV v. [Flemish region of] Vlaams Gewest,"A Belgian gas and electricity supplier, Essent Belgium NV, sought compensation from Vlaams Gewest, a Flemish region of Belgium, where a series of legislative changes had excluded the supplier from a scheme designed to benefit Flemish sources of renewable electricity. The scheme relieved electricity end-users of having to pay for distribution system costsas much as 37% of regional electric billswhen purchasing electricity from qualifying sources, and so made those sources product more attractive and more heavily subscribed. The first version of the scheme extended this benefit only to renewable suppliers that were connected directly to the regions distribution grid; the second, revised version made the benefit available to suppliers located within all of Belgium, even if they were linked to the Flemish regions distribution grid via a high-voltage transmission line. Essent Belgium sources its renewable electricity from facilities located primarily in the Netherlands. 

In support of the claims for compensation it made in a Dutch court, Essent Belgium raised arguments that the scheme violated EU prohibitions on discrimination against goods and services based on their location within or outside of national borders. Rather than resolve those arguments over EU law, the Dutch court referred to the European Court of Justice the preliminary question of whether the schemes discriminatory aspect was permissible. The relevant standard roots in the Principle of Proportionality: if a scheme that has discriminatory effects serves legitimate policy goals effectively and with precision, then it may be permissible because its degree of discrimination is proportionate to its positive outcomes. Though EU policy encourages the development and use of renewable energy, the court noted that this scheme benefited multiple partiesnot only renewable energy facilitiesand that the amount of benefit flowing to one party or another would vary with market conditions. On this basis, the court, rejecting the opinion offered by the Advocate General, concluded that the schemes operation was too indirect, uncertain, and risky to meet the proportionality standard.

Printz Pty. Ltd. v. Glenelg Shire Council,"On March 13, 2009, two weeks after a building permit was granted for a two-story dwelling, an amendment to the Glenelg Planning Scheme entered into effect. That amendment included an Environmental Significance Overlay, which imposed new planning permission requirements where before no environmental review conditions had limited development on parcels like the one at issue. Construction, which had begun just before the amendment entered into effect, was halted on March 25th. After conducting its own review (including a public hearing) of the property owners application seeking to complete construction, the Council voted to approve the application, with conditions. However, it was slow to issue the required permit and the property owner requested review by the Victoria Civil and Administrative Tribunal of the Councils failure to timely issue that permit. The Tribunal examined various features of the property and proposed development, including implications of their location in a coastal wetland and near a fire zone. Before rejecting the property owners permit application, the Tribunal noted that the development plans were at odds with policies encouraging habitat maintenance and biodiversity, and also found that the development would compromise a parcel that would otherwise act as a coastal buffer  a role the Tribunal expected to grow in importance as sea levels rise.

Pandey v. India,"Ridhima Pandey, a nine-year-old from the Uttarakhand region, is the named plaintiff in a climate change case filed in March 2017 with the National Green Tribunal of India. Plaintiffs petition argues that the Public Trust Doctrine, Indias commitments under the Paris Agreement, and Indias existing environmental laws and climate-related policies oblige greater action to mitigate climate change. It also argues that the term environment, as used in the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, necessarily encompasses the climate. 

The case was brought pursuant to section 2(m) of the National Green Tribunal Act 2010, which authorizes claims that raise a substantial question relating to the environment. In addition to those legal provisions, the petition cites the principles of sustainable development, precaution, and intergenerational equity, as well as judicial decisions based on similar legal principles in the Netherlands (Urgenda Foundation v. Kingdom of the Netherlands), Pakistan, (Leghari v. Pakistan), and the U.S. (Juliana v. United States). Pandey argued that she, along with all children and future generations, had the right to a healthy environment under the principle of intergenerational equity. Pandey also argued that climate change affects children disproportionately. Children were more vulnerable to impacts like heat waves, displacement, diseases, and malnutrition. As climate was an inherent part of the environment, she asserted that safeguarding the environment and protecting forests was critical to addressing climate change.

The petition notes that India is the third-largest national emitter of greenhouse gases (behind China and the U.S.) and among those countries that are most susceptible to adverse climate change impacts. It identifies 1 degree Celsius or 350ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide as the critical pair of thresholds for India (and the world) to avoid exceeding for the sake of avoiding severe climatic changesfacts described in the petition as rooted in [t]he best climate science. To remedy the alleged injury to the present and future climate, the petition asks the court to order the national government to undertake a variety of measures, including but not limited to inclusion of climate change in the issues considered by environmental impact assessments, preparation of a national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and preparation of a national carbon budget against which particular projects emissions impacts can be assessed.

On January 15, 2019, the National Green Tribunal dismissed the case, reasoning that the climate change is already covered in the process of impact assessments under the Environment Protection Act of 1986, and therefore, ""There is no reason to presume that Paris Agreement and other international protocols are not reflected in the policies of the Government of India or are not taken into consideration in granting environment clearances.""",Pending,['India>National Green Tribunal'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Youth/Children', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects', 'Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems', 'Suits against governments>Public Trust']",['India>National Green Tribunal Act'],Adequacy of India's climate change mitigation efforts vis-a-vis Public Trust Doctrine and other legal obligations,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/pandey-v-india/
Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change v. Friends of the Earth,"Individuals, solar installation firms, and community organizations coordinated by Friends of the Earth filed legal challenges when the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change proposed a downward revision in the rate at which recipients of a feed-in-tariff (FIT) for solar photovoltaic (PV) would be compensated. Their challenge focused not on the rate reduction per se, but its retroactive implementation for generators who installed solar PV facilities after December 2011 but before April 2012. That is, the suit challenged the Secretarys proposal that those generators begin receiving reduced compensation for electricity generation when the new, lower FIT rate took effect on April 1, 2012. 

Some background on the scheme is helpful for understanding the Secretarys reasons for seeking to push through a rate reduction hastily. The scheme was launched in April 2010 to encourage small-scale low-carbon generators to develop more electricity generating capacity using solar PV, wind, and biomass. Electricity suppliers paid the cost of the FIT and passed it on to electricity consumers. Twice the expected volume of new solar PV capacity was installed over the schemes first 18 months. In light of this and of falling solar PV costs, the Secretary undertook a fast-tracked review of the FIT rate and proposed to revise it downward starting in April 2012, and to compensate all solar PV generators who installed after December 2011 at the reduced rate from April 2012 on. When the review began, there was a surge in solar PV installations, presumably by people who recognized that the window for securing an advantageous FIT rate would soon close. The Secretarys proposed rate reduction thus sought to address both to the unexpectedly high volume of solar PV installation overall and to the surge in installations in advance of the higher rates sunset.

The appellate court upheld the decision and the reasoning of the lower court, which had reviewed the purpose of the Energy Act 2008 on which the FIT scheme was based and the scope of discretion afforded to the Secretary under that Act. The appellate decision explained that rates fixed for a 25-year period starting with the first day of generation are basic to the FIT scheme, and that the scheme makes no provision for adjusting those rates in the way proposed by the Secretary. FIT rates, the court concluded, may be adjusted in prospect, making it permissible for the Secretary to reduce rates for installations coming online after April 1, 2012, but not in retrospect.",Decided; lower court affirmed,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>Court of Appeal>Court of Appeal (Civil Division)'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],['United Kingdom>Energy Act 2008'],Challenge retrospective aspect of proposed feed-in-tariff rate reduction,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/secretary-of-state-for-energy-and-climate-change-v-friends-of-the-earth/

Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc. v. Smith,"New coal mines in Queensland, Australia may only receive permits after completion of a review pursuant to the Mineral Resources Act 1989 (Qld) and of an environmental impact assessment (EIS) pursuant to the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld). By refusing to review the Queensland Supreme Courts decision in Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc v. Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines. The Coast and Country decision adopts the latter view.

The High Court has not, by refusing to review the Supreme Court of Queensland's decision, endorsed that courts reasoning, but it has indicated that it will not take up cases challenging the conclusion in Coast and Country regarding the proper scope of a mines EIA. Legally, the basis for that conclusion relates to lower courts' responsibility for determining factual questions, such as the scope of coal mining operations and the nature of the market for coal. Practically, that conclusion means that environmentalists cannot expect to persuade Queensland courts that the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) requires consideration of whether a new coal mine will increase global greenhouse gas emissions. 

Special leave was refused by the High Court of Australia and the Queensland Court of Appeal.

Petition to the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights Seeking Relief from Violations of the Rights of Arctic Athabaskan Peoples Resulting from Rapid Arctic Warming and Melting Caused by Emissions of Black Carbon by Canada,"A petition filed by Earthjustice on behalf of the Arctic Athabaskan Council alleges that Canadas fragmentary and lax regulations of black carbon emissions threaten the Athabaskan peoples human rights. The petition describes that the arctic is witnessing disproportionately large rates of warming, and alleges that this warming is having significant adverse impacts on the Athabaskan people. Those impacts include ecological disruptions that make hunting and fishing more difficult and dangerous, changes to regional topography of cultural significance, and the compromising of the Athabaskans ability to make sense of their environment for purposes ranging from subsistence to maintenance of cultural traditions. The petition connects these impacts and the warming that causes them to black carbon by explaining that it is a pollutant with severe climate-forcing effects, including the substantial reduction in albedo (reflectivity) of snow and ice. 

According to the petition, Canadas failure to regulate black carbon emissions effectively is the beginning of a causal chain that ends in the violation of the Athabaskans rights to enjoy the benefits of their culture, to property, to the preservation of health, and to their own means of subsistence as established by the American Declaration of the Rights and Duties of Man. That failure also, according to the petition, results in violations of Canadas duties to avoid transboundary harm and to protect the environment consistent with the precautionary principle. 

The petitioners, anticipating arguments that they failed to pursue remedies via administrative proceedings in Canada and its provinces, explain that such an approach was not feasible for the Athabaskans. For relief, the petitioners request: investigations via onsite visit and a hearing before the Commission; a declaration by the Commission that Canadas failure to regulate domestic black carbon emissions violates the American Declaration; and establishment and implementation of a plan to protect the Athabaskan people in coordination with the petitioners and the Athabaskans themselves.

Greece,"The Marangopoulos Foundation for Human Rights (MFHR) alleged that the Greek government was not in compliance with Greek, European, and international law owing to the nature of its oversight (and partial ownership of) several lignite coal mines and coal-fired power plants. Among the legal authorities cited, perhaps most central to MFHRs claims was Article 11 of the European Social Charter of 1961; that article protects citizens right to a clean environment by requiring, among other things, restrictions on pollutants known to compromise human health. MFHRs allegations ranged from the governments failure to prepare adequate environmental impact assessments, to its lax enforcement of pollution control measures, to its failure to achieve reductions in the emission of conventional pollutants and greenhouse gases, to its lack of labor protections. After considering the Greek governments rebuttals, e.g., that it had begun tightening its environmental enforcement regime vis-a-vis the coal mines and power plants at issue, the Committee concluded that Greece had indeed violated several articles 2, 3, and 11 of the European Social Charter.",Decided,['European Committee on Social Rights'],"['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Utilities']",['European Social Charter of 1961'],"Greece's governance of coal miles and power plants with respect to those facilities impacts on the environment, human health, and occupational health and safety",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/marangopoulos-foundation-human-rights-mfhr-v-greece/

That EA considered the mines expected Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions, but not its Scope 3 emissions. The court declared that approval void on the grounds that it was at odds with the language of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act (NSW) 1979 and with the principles of precaution and intergenerational equitythe environmental assessment must be broad, as a matter of law.

Cadzow Enterprises Pty Ltd v Port Phillip County Council,"Residents challenged the County Councils decision to permit construction of a two-story house near Port Phillip Bay. Though the residents did not make arguments related to climate change or flooding, the Tribunal did, sua sponte. Specifically, it sought information from the regional flood control authority, Melbourne Water, about changes to flood risk driven by sea level rise. That query prompted Melbourne Water to examine the property and recommend requiring the house be elevated substantially above what was called for in the permitted design. The Tribunal found that this recommendation reflected the best available information and, citing the precautionary principle and principle of intergenerational equity, authorized grant of the permit subject to the requirement that the house be elevated per Melbourne Waters recommendation.

Department of Premier and Cabinet (General),"A journalist challenged the government of Victorias refusal to produce all of the documents responsive to his request under the Freedom of Information Act 1982. The documents, dated from April to December 2009, all pertained to the Victorian governments position on climate change issues and options for reconciling Victorian and federal climate policy. The Tribunal evaluated arguments relating to each of 11 contested documents and ultimately concluded that the interest of the public weighed on both sides of the case: the public had an interest in knowing how the Victorian and federal governments had negotiated issues related to climate change policy; but the public also had an interest in the Victorian governments staff being free to deliberate without concern that those deliberations should be public. On this basis, the Tribunal upheld the governments refusal to produce the 11 contested documents.

Owen v. Casey City Council,"The Applicant sought a planning permit for two dwellings. The Casey City Council refused to issue a permit on multiple grounds, including vulnerability of the design to the impacts of climate change. All of the grounds were challenged by the Applicant in the Victorian Civil and Administrative Tribunal. The Tribunal decided state policy requiring the assessment and management of wider risks and consequences of the proposed development to the community meant the Applicant must prepare a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment even though Melbourne Water, the referral Authority, did not object to the permit. The Tribunal expressed concern that the subsequent assessment report did not address risks of inland or riverine flooding in addition to coastal flooding, however it refused the permit application on unrelated grounds. 
The same parties again came before the Tribunal after Owen commissioned an assessment. The Tribunal found the assessment inadequate because it had considered only flooding related to coastal hazards and had ignored the risks attendant to riverine flooding, which was also expected to worsen with climate change.

Pridel Investments Pty. Ltd. v. Coffs Harbour City Council,"This case dealt with the Coffs Harbour City Councils rejection of Pridel Investments application to develop a 39-lot subdivision. The city councils grounds for rejection included unacceptably high flooding risk, failure to consider various climate change impacts in accordance with state and national coastal and climate policy, and sustainable development principles as required by the local planning programthe Our Living City Settlement Strategy. The court noted that the plans for construction assumed a 100-year lifespan for the subdivision, but relied on several assumptions about how well existing dunes and other features of the location would withstand climate change, noting that the Councils objections were not dependent on climate change, but rather a current risk that the protective dune and vegetation will be eroded.

Mataatua District Maori Council v. New Zealand,"Representatives of the Mataatua District Maori Council have filed a claim and supporting memorandum in the Waitangi Tribunal, the forum where disputes over the performance of the Treaty of Waitangi between Maori and the government of New Zealand are heard and resolved. The claimants allege that New Zealand has breached its obligations to Maori by failing to implement policies that will address climate change. Specifically, the claimants allege that the Crown has breached the Treaty of Waitangi by: failing to take adequate steps to ensure that New Zealand bears its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions reductions; setting inadequate emissions reductions targets; continuing to ineffectively address New Zealand's emissions through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZETS); failing to develop policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions outside of the NZETS; and failing to fulfil its Treaty obligations to consult with Maori over climate change policies.

Upon learning from the Tribunal Registry that the claim would be heard after 2020, the claimants filed an urgency application requesting an earlier hearing. That application seeks the following forms of relief:
	a declaration from the Tribunal that the government has breached its treaty obligations;
	a recommendation that New Zealand revise its emissions reduction targets upward to a level that corresponds with keeping the global concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 450ppmthe level that corresponds with the 2C threshold that demarcates a stable climate from a potentially unstable one;
	a recommendation that New Zealand adopt different mitigation policies, including the restructuring or replacement of its Emissions Trading Scheme;
	a recommendation that New Zealand adopt policies that facilitate adaptation in ways specific to locations and resources relied upon by Maori.
  
It bases these requests for relief on several points of fact and law. The most basic of these is the relationship between sources of GHG emissions and climate changes, and the relationship between climate change and various adverse impacts on locations and resources relied upon by Maori for physical and cultural purposes. The application also points out that New Zealands Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted following the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, committed the country to reduce emissions by 11% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. It contrasts this target with the increase of GHG emissions in New Zealand of 24.1% relative to their 1990 levels by 2015 and the current expectation that they will increase to 30% increase by 2020. Further facts noted in the application include that New Zealands government encourages oil and gas exploration, controls an entity that mines coal, and controls another entity that is responsible for much of the recent conversion of forests to dairy farms. Having described the factual basis that links government policies adverse climate impacts, the claimants then point out that provisions of the Waitangi Treaty make the government responsible for the active protection of natural resources such as forests and fisheries on behalf of Maori. In characterizing that violation, the claimants quote from the recent decision in Juliana v. United States regarding the public trust doctrine and characterize that reasoning as relevant to their claim.",Undecided,['New Zealand>Waitangi Tribunal'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Indigenous Groups', 'Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems']","['New Zealand>Treaty of Waitangi', 'New Zealand>Climate Change Response Act 2002']",Determine whether New Zealand climate change policy violates Treaty of Waitangi with Maori,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mataatua-district-maori-council-v-new-zealand/
Public Prosecutor's Office v. Oliveira &amp; Others,"Sao Paolo's state prosecutor sought to enjoin regional farmers from employing a low-tech form of sugar refining that involves burning sugar cane. Arguments against the practice included its harms to air quality, its release of greenhouse gas emissions, and its harmful affects on human health--particularly that of farm workers. Hearing the case on appeal, the Superior Court of Justice determined that burning should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances, and that sugar refining in general must be less polluting, even if that means being more capital-intensive. In arriving at its decision, the Court acknowledged the appellants' argument that burning cane does not add greenhouse gases to the atmosphere on a net basis over a multi-year timeframe, because it only releases gases absorbed by the cane over the prior 12-18 months.

Friends of the Irish Environment CLG v. Fingal County Council,"Friends of the Irish Environment challenged the Fingal County Councils decision to issue a five-year extension to the Dublin Airport Authority for their planning permission to construct a new runway. The court declined to grant any of the relief sought by plaintiffs because they failed to assert a viable claim for standing. However, in a historic first, the High Court issued a judgment recognizing a personal constitutional right to an environment under the Irish Constitution. Despite finding a lack of standing, the High Court issued a comprehensive review of the merits in anticipation of a future appeal.

The High Court declared that, A right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large is an essential condition for the fulfilment of all human rights. It is an indispensable existential right that is enjoyed universally, yet which is vested personally as a right that presents and can be seen always to have presented, and to enjoy protection, under Art. 40.3.1 of the Constitution. The Court elaborated that this right was not so Utopian as to prevent enforcement, but would rather become enforceable once made concrete through the definition and demarcation of specific duties and obligations. The High Court explained that recognizing this previously unenumerated constitutional right was a first step in this process to define and demarcate a right to an environment.

However, the High Court did not find that the Fingal County Council violated this newly recognized right to an environment by extending the planning permission for the runway. The Court explained, . . . even though the court accepts that members of the [Friends of Irish Environment] enjoy the contended-for constitutional right, and that the [Friends of the Irish Environment] itself has standing as a body corporate, and has a sufficient basis to contend for recognition of that existing but unenumerated constitutional right, the [Friends of the Irish Environment] nevertheless did not have a right to participate in the extension decision under [Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000] (there is no such right of participation) and it has failed to establish that there is, by reference to that section and on the facts presenting, any disproportionate interference with the personal constitutional right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large. In truth, the court sees in [Section 42] nothing more than a proper and proportionate legislative interference with the said, ever-present and now expressly recognised personal constitutional right.

Further, the High Court ruled that Friends of the Irish Environment did not fulfill standing requirements under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, Article 11 of the Consolidated EIA Directive, or the Aarhus Convention (i.e. the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters adopted on 25th June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus). The High Court found that neither the Planning and Development Act 2000 nor the Consolidated EIA contained requirements for further public participation in granting an extension of a planning permission. Claims concerning the original decision to grant a planning permission in 2007 were deemed impermissible collateral attacks.

The Court did not find that the Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 changed the substance of Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act in a way relevant to the claims of this case. Section 15 creates an obligation that ""A relevant body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to . . . the furtherance of the national transition objective, and the objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change in the State."" The High Court said that the Fingal Council would only need to provide reasons if it elected to entirely depart from the objectives of Section 15. The High Court did not believe this this sort of departure was present in the case at hand.

"Plan B Earth and Others v. The Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy","Plan B Earth, a charity with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, has filed a climate change lawsuit against the Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State). Plan B Earth is joined in the lawsuit by 11 citizen claimants ranging in age from 9 to 79 who are impacted by climate change in a variety of ways. The claimants allege that the Secretary of State violated the Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) and other law by failing to revise a 2050 carbon reduction target in light of new international law and scientific developments.

On December 8, 2017, the claimants filed a claim form and a document listing their grounds for judicial review at the High Court of Justice Administrative Court. They note that the 2008 Act set a carbon emissions reduction target for the year 2050 that is at least 80% lower than the aggregate total of the UKs greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 (the 2050 target). This 2050 target was consistent with limiting average warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The claimants argue that the Secretary of State should make the 2050 target more ambitious to reflect scientific developments since 2008 and the Paris Agreements intention to limit average warming to 1.5 degrees C. Under Section 2 of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State has the authority to revise the target in light of scientific developments and international law. 

Claimants present five grounds for seeking judicial review of the Secretary of States failure to revise the 2050 target: (1) it is ultra vires, because it frustrates the legislative purpose of the 2008 Act; (2) it is based on an error of law regarding the objective of the Paris Agreement; (3) it is irrational, because it fails to take into account and / or inappropriately weighs considerations including the risks of global climate change and predictions of future technical innovation; (4) it violates the Human Rights Act 1998; and (5) it breaches the public sector equality duty set out in Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.

Claimants seek declaratory relief that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of his responsibilities under the 2008 Act and a mandatory order that the Secretary of State revise the 2050 target in accordance with the purpose of the 2008 Act and the UKs international law obligations, ensuring, at a minimum, that the 2050 target commits the UK to an equitable contribution the Paris Agreement objective and that it conforms to the precautionary principle. They also seek what other relief the court deems appropriate and costs.

In February, 2018, the claimants' application for judicial review was denied on all five grounds. The claimants renewed their application for review. On March 20, 2018, a permission hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand to determine if the case was strong enough to merit a full hearing. The hearing was adjourned after the Justice decided that the complexity of the issues would require a full-day permission hearing. The Justice also requested a more detailed statement from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The Committee is an interested party in the litigation.

On July 20, 2018, the High Court found the claims were not arguable and denied permission for the case to proceed. Plan B Earth appealed the decision on multiple grounds, including alleging that the judge misinterpreted Article 2(1)(a)of the Paris Agreement. Appellants argue that the judge incorrectly read this provision to allow for a range of ambition rather than holding the UK for responsible for [h]olding  the increase  in  the  global  average  temperature  to  well  below  2C  above  pre-industrial levels and pursuing  efforts  to  limit  the  temperature  increase  to  1.5C  above  pre-industrial levels. Accordingly, appellants further argue that the judge incorrectly found the current UK 2050 climate target compatible with the Paris Agreement due to this misinterpretation of required ambition.

On January 25, 2019, the Court of Appeal rejected Plan B's appeal of the High Court's denial to hear the case, marking the end of the appeal process. The court concluded that none of the 7 stated grounds had a real prospect of success. The court did not find an error in law in regard to an alleged failure to exercise discretion to amend the 2050 target, nor did the court find that the Secretary of State misunderstood the Paris Agreement or the advice of the Committee on Climate Change.

Future Generations v. Ministry of the Environment and Others,"According to a press release and copy of the complaint obtained from the organization Dejusticia, 25 youth plaintiffs between the ages of 7 and 26 years old have sued several bodies within the Colombian government, Colombian municipalities, and a number of corporations to enforce their claimed rights to a healthy environment, life, health, food, and water. The plaintiffs allege that climate change along with the government's failure to reduce deforestation and ensure compliance with a target for zero-net deforestation in the Colombian Amazon by the year 2020, (as agreed under the Paris Agreement and the National Development Plan 2014-2018), threatens plaintiffs fundamental rights. The youth plaintiffs have filed a special constitutional claim called a tutela used to enforce fundamental rights. 

A lower court ruled against the youth plaintiffs. Youth plaintiffs filed an appeal on February 16, 2018.

On April 5, 2018, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court decision, recognizing that the ""fundamental rights of life, health, the minimum subsistence, freedom, and human dignity are substantially linked and determined by the environment and the ecosystem."" It further recognized the Colombian Amazon as a subject of rights in the same manner that the Constitutional Court recognized the Atrato River. The Supreme Court declared that the Colombian Amazon accordingly was entitled to protection, conservation, maintenance, and restoration.

"A Request for an Advisory Opinion from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights Concerning the Interpretation of Article 1(1), 4(1) and 5(1) of the American Convention on Human Rights","The Inter-American Court of Human Rights issued an advisory opinion finding that the right to a healthy environment is a human right. The opinion noted that the adverse effects of environmental degradation and climate change both affect human rights. This finding suggests that the right to a healthy environment may serve as a pathway for lawsuits brought in regard to climate change-related harms. The opinion further discussed the responsibility of governments for significant environmental damage that they cause within and beyond their borders. 

The Courts advisory opinion enables all States who recognize the jurisdiction of the Courtand the citizens of those countriesto file claims regarding environmental harms that impact their human rights. In such a case, the Court would assess whether the respondent State met three types of obligations:

1.	Obligations to Prevent Environmental Damages:
States must: A) issue regulations to prevent damages, B) establish contingency plans to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents, C) mitigate significant damage that has already occurred, and D) carry out environmental impact studies under the conditions indicated by the Court. The Court requires environmental impact studies to address cumulative impacts, allow the participation of interested persons, and respect the traditions and culture of indigenous peoples. These studies must also be conducted by independent entities and occur prior to the activities that they evaluate. 

2.	Obligations to Cooperate: 
States must: A) cooperate in good faith with States and individuals potentially affected by environmental damage, B) notify potentially affected States that a planned activity under their jurisdiction could generate a risk of significant transboundary damages and of environmental emergencies, and C) negotiate in good faith with States potentially affected by significant transboundary harm.

3.	Obligations to Provide Information, Justice, and Public Participation: 
States must: A) access to information related to possible effects on the environment, B) the opportunity for citizens to publicly participate in making decisions and policies that may affect the environment, and C) access to justice through national courts in regard to their environmental obligations. The Court clarified that persons potentially affected by transboundary damages must have access to justice without discrimination based on their nationality, residence, or the location of the environmental damage.",Decided,['Inter-American System of Human Rights>Inter-American Court of Human Rights'],['Advisory Opinions'],['American Convention on Human Rights>San Salvador Protocol'],"In an advisory opinion, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights recognized the right to a healthy environment as a human right ",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/request-advisory-opinion-inter-american-court-human-rights-concerning-interpretation-article-11-41-51-american-convention-human-rights/
Armando Ferrao Carvalho and Others v. The European Parliament and the Council,"Ten families, including children, from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji, and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Saminuorra, brought an action in the EU General Court seeking to compel the EU to take more stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Plaintiffs allege that the EUs existing target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, is insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and threatens plaintiffs fundamental rights of life, health, occupation, and property.

The lawsuit has two major components. First, plaintiffs bring a nullification action, asking the court to declare three EU legal acts as void for failing to set adequate GHG emissions targets. The three EU legal acts are: Directive 2003/87/EC governing emissions from large power generation installations (ETS); regulation 2018/EU on emissions from industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and etc. (ESR); and regulation 2018/EU on emissions from and removals by land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Plaintiffs argue that inadequate emissions reductions violate higher order laws that protect fundamental rights to health, education, occupation, and equal treatment as well as provide obligations to protect the environment. These higher rank laws include: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (ChFR), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs ask the court to order that the three emissions reductions laws remain in force until improved versions of the Acts can be enacted. Art. 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) is the basis for this procedural action.

The second action concerns non-contractual liability. Article 340 of the TFEU provides a mechanism for injunctive relief when three conditions are met: 1) there is an unlawful act by the EU institution(s), 2) the unlawful act is a serious breach of a law that protects individual rights, and 3) there is a sufficient causal link between the breach and the damages.

Demanded relief is an injunction to compel the EU to set more stringent GHG emissions reductions targets through the existing framework of the ETS, ESR and LULUCF regimes in order to bring the EU into compliance with its legal obligations. Plaintiffs assert this would require a 50%-60% reduction in GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 or whatever level the court finds appropriate. 

The European General Court did not rule on the merits, but dismissed the case on procedural grounds, finding that the plaintiffs could not bring the case since they are not sufficiently and directly affected by these policies (direct and individual concern criterion). The court concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case because climate change affects every individual in one manner or another and case law requires that plaintiffs are affected by the contested act in a manner that is peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons, and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually. The court rejected plaintiffs argument that the interpretation of the concept of individual concern referred to in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU is not compatible with a fundamental right to effective judicial protection under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nor did the court find that plaintiffs could bring the case under the other possible criteria under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 of the TFEU which would require that they were direct addressees of the legislative package in question or they contested a regulatory act that was of direct concern to them.

The plaintiffs appealed to the European Court of Justice on July 11, 2019, arguing that the EU General Court erred in concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing under Article 263, and by holding that plaintiffs needed to establish standing under Article 263 in order to bring a claim for non-contractual liability.

On March 25, 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the General Court's order and held the plaintiff's claims inadmissible on standing grounds for failing to demonstrate that they were individually impacted by Europe's climate policy. The ECJ rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the General Court did not take into account the climate harms specific to them. Rather, the ECJ found sufficient the lower court's reasoning that ""the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another does not mean that, for that reason, there exists standing to bring an action against a measure of general application,"" and that doing so would render standing limitations meaningless. Further, the ECJ rejected the argument that, by invoking an infringement of fundamental rights, the plaintiffs had established standing. ""[T]he appellants reasoning, in addition to its generic wording, leads to the conclusion that there is locus standi for any applicant, since a fundamental right is always likely to be concerned in one way or another by measures of general application such as those contested in the present case."" The ECJ thus dismissed the appeal and ordered plaintiffs to pay costs incurred by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU.

Greenpeace Indonesia and Others v. Bali Provincial Governor,"Greenpeace Indonesia and three local residents of Buleleng District, Bali challenged the Bali Governor's granting of environmental permits for the expansion of the Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant through Bali Governor's Decree No.660.3 / 3985 / IV-A / DISPMPT. Plaintiffs allege that  the Bali Governor violated Environmental Law No.32 of 2009 and international commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by granting the environmental permits without consideration of the climate impacts of adding two 330 MW coal-fired units to the project. The Celukan Bawang Coal-Fired Power Plant Company is a defendant intervenor in the litigation.

Nine Indonesian and international environmental groups filed an amici curiae brief in the proceeding before the Denpasar Administrative Court. They join the plaintiffs in asserting that the project does not comply with the Environmental Protection and Environmental Law No.32 of 2009 and undermines Indonesias international climate commitments because the Bali Governor did not conduct a comprehensive analysis of climate change impacts of the plant expansion.

Friends of the Earth and Others v. Secretary of State for Transport,"The case concerned the legality of the governments Airport National Policy Statement (ANPS), the policy framework adopted under the Planning Act 2008 (the Planning Act), which provides in-principle support for Heathrow airport expansion. 

In February 2020, the Court of Appealed ruled that the ANPS had not been lawfully adopted, as the Government had not considered the Paris Agreement. However, in December 2020 the UK Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals decision, ruling that the Governments ANPS was produced lawfully. Due to this, developers are now able to apply for development consent (planning permission) to expand Heathrow Airport. The judgment makes clear, however, that full climate considerations must be taken into account at the planning permission stage meaning that there are still phases left to satisfy before the runway can actually be built. To date, no application for planning permission has been made.

In August 2018, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland (FoE EWNI) and Plan B Earth (Plan B; a British non-profit with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change), filed separate legal claims against the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, (the Secretary of State) alleging inadequate consideration of climate change impacts in regards to the ANPS. Additional claimants also brought legal challenges, including some local authorities and the NGO Greenpeace, but it was Plan B and FoE EWNI who took the lead on the climate-related claims. Additionally, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) and Arora Holdings Limited (Arora) defended the decision to adopt the ANPS as interested parties.  

FoE ENWI relied on section 10 of the Planning Act in their arguments against the Government. Section 10 requires that the adoption or review of a national policy statement must be a done in a way that contributes to sustainable development, and that  particular regard is had to the desirability of  mitigating the effects of climate change. FoE EWNIs four grounds were that the Secretary of State had:
	failed to consider the UKs commitments to the Paris Agreement; 
	failed to consider the non-CO2 warming impacts of aviation; 
	Failed to consider the climate impacts of the expansion beyond the current 2050 reduction UK target as set by the Climate Change Act 2008; and
	Not complied with the EC Council Directive 2001/42/EC (the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive; as implemented through the SEA Regulations). 

Plan B argued that the Governments commitment to the Paris Agreement was already part of government policy, and therefore that the Government had breached section 5(8) of the Planning Act. Under section 5(8), the Secretary of State must include an explanation of how the ANPS considers Government policy to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. 

In May 2019, the case went before the Divisional Court (with two judges; a High Court Judge and a senior judge). The court dismissed all the claims, including those filed by FoE EWNI and Plan B. 

The claimants appealed, and the case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2019. In February 2020, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Divisional Court, unanimously agreeing with both FoE EWNI and Plan B on all their grounds. The appeals brought by the other parties, such as the local authorities, were dismissed.  

In their judgement the Court recognised that, the legal issues are of the highest importance ... Both the development itself and its effects will last well into the second half of the century, (Court of Appeal judgment, para. 277).
The court concluded that the Government commitments to the Paris Agreement formed a part of Government policy by the time the ANPS was prepared. The Secretary of State, as a result, needed to expressly consider and address the Paris Agreement when adopting the ANPS. 

The court held that by failing to consider the Paris Agreement, the Secretary of State breached the Planning Act on the basis of s.5(8) (Plan Bs ground) and s.10 (FoE EWNIs ground). The failure to consider the non-CO2 warming impacts, or to consider the climate impacts beyond 2050 were further breaches of s.10 (FoE EWNIs grounds). Furthermore, its failure to consider the Paris Agreement in the strategic environmental assessment meant that it had also breached the SEA Directive (FoE EWNIs ground).

The Court therefore concluded that the ANPS was of no legal effect and must be reviewed so that the legal errors could be corrected. In response, the Government stated that it would not challenge this decision. 

In February 2020, HAL and Arora(the two commercial entities, which were interested parties in the case) applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. In May 2020, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. Arora subsequently withdrew, so when the case went before the Supreme Court for the substantive hearing in October 2020, the sole appellant was HAL. The Government did not participate in the appeal. FoE EWNI and Plan B were the respondents to the appeal and defended the decision by the Court of Appeal. HALs appeal challenged the Court of Appeals ruling in relation to all four grounds argued by FoE EWNI, and Plan Bs s.5(8) ground. In December 2020, the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeals decision in full. The judgments conclusions in relation to FoE EWNIs grounds were as follows:

Firstly, the Secretary of State had a broad discretion on what to consider in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change through sustainable development under section 10 of the Planning Act. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary of State had acted lawfully, and to the extent that he needed to consider the Paris Agreement, had done so through consideration of the emission reduction commitments in the Climate Change Act 2008. 

Secondly, the SEA conducted was lawful, and did not need to expressly refer to the Paris Agreement. Full consideration to climate matters would take place at the stage of applying for planning permission.   

Thirdly and fourthly, the Secretary did not act irrationally in excluding post-2050 and non-CO2 emissions. There was uncertainty over the quantification of non-CO2 impacts, and both these and post 2050 emissions could be considered at the planning stage. 

In relation to Plan Bs ground, the Supreme Court found that the Paris Agreement itself did not constitute government policy under section 5(8) of the Planning Act, giving the term in the legislation a relatively narrow meaning, (UK Supreme Court judgment at para.10).

As there is no onward appeal from the UK Supreme Court, this case cannot be taken further. The ANPS has therefore been reinstated with full legal effect, so that a developer can now apply for planning permission for the expansion of Heathrow airport. Details of the implications of the judgement are included in the Friends of the Earth briefing.

McVeigh v. Retail Employees Superannuation Trust,"On November 2, 2020, the parties reached a settlement where the Australian pension fund agreed to incorporate climate change financial risks in its investments and implement a net-zero by 2050 carbon footprint goal. More on the settlement below. 

An Australian pension fund member filed suit against the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust (REST) alleging that the fund violated the Corporations Act 2001 by failing to provide information related to climate change business risks and any plans to address those risks. The case was filed in the Federal Court of Australia in July 2018.

The plaintiff, Mark McVeigh has contributed to REST since 2013. Under the Corporations Act 2001, super fund beneficiaries are entitled to request information that they need to make an informed decision about the management and financial condition of the fund. The plaintiff requested information from REST regarding the: (a) knowledge of RESTs Climate Change Business Risks; (b) opinion of Climate Change, the Physical Risks, the Transition Risks and RESTs Climate Change Business Risks; (c) actions responding to RESTs Climate Change Business Risks; and (d) compliance with its obligations under the Corporations Act and other law with respect to RESTs Climate Change Business Risks. The first complaint alleges that the information provided by REST did not fulfill its obligations and thus seeks declaratory relief that REST violated the Corporations Act by failing to disclose the requested information and an injunction requiring REST to provide that information. In the alternative, plaintiff seeks a declaration and injunction in equitable jurisdiction.

In September 2018 plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging, in addition to the claims listed above, that REST has violated the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act). The SIS Act requires trustees to act with care, skill, and diligence, and to perform their duties and exercise their powers in the best interests of their beneficiaries. The amended complaint alleges that a prudent superannuation trustee would have, among other things, required its investment managers to provide the type of information that McVeigh requested regarding climate change; and ensure that its processes for managing investments and disclosing climate change business risks to beneficiaries complied with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. 

In January 2019 the court issued an order on plaintiff's application for maximum costs, which is a mechanism to allow individuals bringing cases in the public interest to avoid legal costs. The court concluded that, ""the case appears to raise a socially significant issue about the role of superannuation trusts and trustees in the current public controversy about climate change. It is legitimate to describe the Applicants litigation as being of a public interest nature."" However, the court determined that more information was needed about plaintiff's ability to proceed if his application was denied. The parties later resolved the issue among themselves.

Before the trial was set to begin, the REST reached a settlement with the plaintiff and set out the details of the settlement in a press release. REST acknowledged that ""Climate change is a material, direct and current financial risk to the superannuation fund across many risk categories, including investment, market, reputational, strategic, governance and third-party risks."" To address this risk, Rest agreed to implement a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050 goal for the fund, to measure, monitor and report climate progress in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures, to ensure investee climate disclosure, and to publicly disclose portfolio holdings, among other commitments.

"Greenpeace Canada v. Minister of the Environment, Conservation, and Parks; Lieutenant Governor in Council","On October 11, 2019, the Superior Court of Ontario dismissed Greenpeace's case on the grounds that declaratory relief was not available. Two of the three judges reasoned that declaratory relief would have no practical effect because the statute that gave authority for the regulation at issue had been repealed. Had declaratory relief been able to have practical effect, two of the judges would have found that the Ontario government was required to participate in public participation before enacting the cancelling regulation.

Prior to the dismissal, on January 25, 2019, the court rejected a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the dispute was moot, reasoning that there was still a live dispute over whether the public participation in question was lawful. 

Environmental groups filed suit against the Ontarian government, alleging the government failed to meet legal requirements for public consultation on regulations that would end Ontarios cap and trade program and a proposed bill that would undercut the provinces legislative regime for combatting climate change. Plaintiffs argued that both the regulations and bill violate requirements under the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) for public participation in the development of environmentally significant regulations and legislation. 

The lawsuit concerns Ontario Regulation 386/18 filed on July 3, 2018 by the Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks. The government did not conduct a public consultation process and filed a claim that the 2018 election was substantially equivalent to the 30-day consultation process required by law. Plaintiffs argued that the government was still required to undertake public consultation for the regulation under the EBR and that the regulation is ultra vires because it contradicts the purpose of the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act, the enabling act for this regulation. The lawsuit additionally concerned Bill 4, the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018 filed on July 25, 2018. This bill would repeal the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016 which includes greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Plaintiffs argued that this bill would have a significant environmental impact because it would repeal existing greenhouse gas emissions targets without establishing new targets. If there is a significant environmental impact, then the government must undertake the mandatory notice and comment process required by the EBR. 

Plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and asked the Court to quash the regulations.

Family Farmers and Greenpeace Germany v. Germany,"In October 2018, three German families and Greenpeace Germany filed suit in the Administrative Court of Berlin, asking the court to oblige the German government to update or supplement the National Climate Protection Programme 2020.  

In December 2014, the German cabinet set a goal of reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by 40% until the end of 2020, as compared to 1990 (the Climate Protection Plan). According to the governments 2018 official climate protection report, however, reduction was likely to only reach 32%. The German families were comprised of organic farmers who claimed to already be experiencing the impacts of climate change. Plaintiffs argued that the government was bound by the Climate Protection Plan and alleged that the governments failure to adhere to the 40% target encroaches on their human rights in violation of Article 2(2) (right to life and health), Article 12(1) (occupational freedom), and Article 14(1) (right to property) of the Basic Law. They further alleged that failure to meet the original 2020 goal breached Germanys minimum obligations under the EU Effort Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC), which determines the contributions of the respective Member States to achieve a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions throughout the Community in economic sectors not subject to EU emissions trading.

The plaintiffs asked the court to hold that the government is obliged to: 1) implement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 by updating or supplementing appropriate measures to meet the 2020 target; 2) compensate for the excess of approximately 650 million tons of CO2 equivalent, accrued between 2007 and the time of delivery of the judgement, due to insufficient implementation of the 2020 target; and 3) supplement the national Climate Protection Program 2020 to meet the reduction targets set out in European environmental law.

On October 31, 2019 the Administrative Court of Berlin dismissed the case, concluding that the action was inadmissible for lack of standing. In its view, the Climate Protection Program 2020 was not legally binding, as it only constituted a political declaration of intent without any external effect on which plaintiffs could base their legal claims. The court further held that plaintiffs had not conclusively demonstrated that the government had violated their fundamental rights by setting inadequate climate protection targets, as the mere fact that a very large number of people are affected by the effects of climate change does not rule out the possibility that they may be affected individually. However, the court did find that the governments climate policy is subject to judicial review and must be consistent with the governments duties to protect fundamental rights under the Basic Law, Germanys constitution. The court also determined that the government must undertake measures to provide adequate and effective protection of the fundamental rights potentially affected by climate change, including the rights to life and property. Nonetheless, the court concluded that the government is entitled to wide discretion in deciding how to meet these obligations, so long as precautionary measures to protect fundamental rights are not entirely unsuitable or wholly inadequate. In the courts view, the governments protection policy, which aimed to lower emissions by 32% rather than 40% by the end of 2020, was within this discretional margin.",Dismissed,['Germany>Berlin>Administrative Court'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other'],"['Germany>Constitution', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>Sharing Decision (406/2009/EC)']",Whether the German Federal Government violated plaintiffs constitutional rights and EU law through insufficient action to meet its 2020 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/family-farmers-and-greenpeace-germany-v-german-government/
ClientEarth v. Enea,"ClientEarth, a non-profit environmental law organization and shareholder in the Polish utility Enea SA, has sued that company, seeking the annulment of a resolution consenting to construction of the 1.2bn 1GW Ostroeka C coal-fired power plant. The claim is brought under the Polish Commercial Companies Code.

The plaintiffs report that the lawsuit claims the consent resolution for construction of the power plant harms the economic interests of the company as a result of climate-related financial risks, including: rising carbon prices, increased competition from cheaper renewables, and the impact of EU energy reforms on state subsidies for coal power under the capacity market. On September 19, 2018, in advance of filing the pleadings, plaintiffs lawyers wrote to Enea stating that ClientEarth regarded the proposed resolution, and the Management Boards proposal of that resolution, as clearly and obviously harmful to the interests of Enea and its shareholders and warned that Eneas ongoing actions in relation to the plant risk breaching board members fiduciary duties of due diligence and to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders. The claim was filed on October 24, 2018 in the Regional Court in Poznan (Sad Okregowy w Poznaniu). 

On August 1, 2019, the court found the company resolution authorizing construction of the power plant to be legally invalid. Further discussion of the reasoning will be added to this profile upon review of a translation of the full decision.

During the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the respondent company, resolution giving its directional consent to commence the construction phase of the  project of building coal-fired power station (1 GW) in Ostroeka, Poland. 

In the opinion of the Poznan Regional Court, the contested resolution encroaches upon the powers of the company's management board to manage its affairs, exceeding, in this respect, the powers of the general meeting and, at the same time, constitutes a binding instruction for the management board to manage the company's affairs. 

With the facts thus established, the Regional Court firstly pointed out that, pursuant to
Article 425  1 of the Commercial Companies Code (CCC) a resolution of the shareholders' meeting of a joint-stock company may be declared invalid if the resolution is contrary to the law.

In the opinion of the Poznan Regional Court, the plaintiff's claims are justified, in particular as regards the contradiction of the appealed resolution with Article 368  1 of the CCC, Article 3751 of the CCC and Article 384 of the CCC. According to the principles of organisation and functioning of a joint-stock company, it operates through its organs, which are the management board, the supervisory board and the general meeting. Each of these bodies may act within the limits of its powers under the law and the articles of association. In particular, the statutory body appointed and authorised to manage the company's affairs and represent it externally is the board of directors. For these reasons, the Poznan Regional Court declared the resolution invalid.

The judgment in question was appealed to the Appellate Court in Poznan, 1st Civil Division and Intellectual Property Division, which dismissed the appeal by judgment of 8 July 2020.

Aspects strictly related to climate change were part of the arguments in the ClientEarth Foundation's claim, but they were not the warp of the judgment. The Regional Court in Poznan based its ruling solely on the formal aspects of the adoption of the resolution and the fact that the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders exceeded the powers granted to this body by the Commercial Companies Code.  As a result of the court's invalidation of this resolution, the investor abandoned the project to build a coal-fired power station in Ostroeka.

ENVironnement JEUnesse v. Procureur General du Canada,"ENvironnement JEUnesse, an environmental nonprofit, has applied in the Superior Court of Quebec to bring a climate change-related class action against the Canadian government on behalf of Quebec citizens aged 35 and under. ENvironnement JEUnesse reports that it has asked the Court, inter alia, to declare that the Government of Canada has failed in its obligations to protect the fundamental rights of young people under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The organization alleges that the government violated plaintiffs rights by setting a greenhouse gas reduction target insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change impacts and by lacking an adequate plan to reach its greenhouse gas emission target. 

More specifically, plaintiffs allege that 1) the Canadian government's adoption of GHG emission targets that it knows are harmful to human life and health violates the right of class members to life, inviolability and security protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter and section 1 of the Quebec Charter, and 2) by adopting inadequate targets and failing to put in place the necessary measures to achieve these targets, the government is violating the class members' right to live in a healthful environment in which biodiversity is preserved, protected by the Quebec Charter. 

The class action seeks a declaratory judgment and punitive damages. They have also asked the court to order a cessation of interference with plaintiffs rights.

On July 11, 2019, the court dismissed the motion for authorization to institute a class action. The judge concluded that the impact of climate change on human rights is a justiciable issue and that the Canadian Charters and Quebec rights and freedoms can apply to government actions in this area. However, the judge declined to authorize the proposed class, determining that the 35-year age cut-off was arbitrary and not objective. Environment JEUnesse appealed the decision on August 16.

On December 13th, 2021, the Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on justiciability and denied the certification of the proposed climate change class action suit. The Court found that all the alleged facts accuse the Canadian government of a fault of omission resulting from its inaction in the face of global warming. Conclusions sought by the Appellants are tantamount to asking the courts to tell the legislature what to do, which is not their role. It held that deference to the legislative power is necessary as it is better placed to weigh the countless challenges of global warming. The Court did not weigh in on the allegation that government actions were contributing to climate change and therefore violated the Charter rights. The Court also objected to the lack of specificity of the remedy requested and agreed with the trial judge that the proposed class was arbitrary since the theory of the case on age discrimination was not acceptable.

"H.J. Banks &amp; Co.  v. Secretary of State for Housing, Communities, and Local Government","H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd challenged the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities, and Local Government under section 288 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 for denying a planning permission for a coal mining project. The High Court quashed the denial on two grounds, including the Secretarys inadequate explanation of how preventing the project would reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

The Northumberland County Council granted planning permission to H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd for a surface mine for the extraction of coal, sandstone, and fireclay in the Highthorn area of southeast Northumberland. The Secretary called the application in for his own determination and after a public inquiry declined to grant permission for the project, giving considerable weight in his decision-making to the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions. H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd challenged the denial on two grounds. The first ground alleged an error in the Secretarys interpretation of balancing considerations under paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The second ground alleged that the Secretary wrongly weighed greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning coal at power plants and that the Secretary acted inconsistently with previous practice in how the Secretary considered these emissions.

The High Court quashed the decision on grounds one and two. On ground one, the High Court determined that the Secretary had not lawfully weighed the relative costs and benefits of tourism and biodiversity as required under the balancing test of paragraph 149 of the NPPF and related regulations. On ground two, the High Court found that the Secretary provided insufficient reasoning to explain why emissions would be reduced if the coal project was denied because there was not adequate explanation of how power generation would be replaced by less carbon-intensive sources rather than imported coal. The Court found that the Secretary provided inadequate reasoning for how national policy to decarbonize was inconsistent with granting the permission.

Notre Affaire a Tous and Others v. France,"On December 17, 2018, four nonprofits sent a lettre prealable indemnitaire (letter of formal notice) to Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and 12 members of the French government, initiating the first stage in a legal proceeding against the French government for inadequate action on climate change. This type of letter is part of a legal proceeding known as recours en carence fautive (action for failure to act). The plaintiffs allege that the French governments failure to implement proper measures to effectively address climate change violated a statutory duty to act. The four plaintiff groups are Fondation pour la Nature et lHomme (FNH), Greenpeace France, Notre Affaire a Tous and Oxfam France. In their press release, they describe the lawsuit as challenging the state's inaction on climate change and failure to meet its own goals for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, increasing renewable energy, and limiting energy consumption.

On February 15, 2019, the French government rejected the plaintiffs' request. On March 14, 2019, the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit by filing a ""summary request"" before the Administrative Court of Paris. The plaintiffs request that the State of France be enjoined to remedy its inadequate action on climate change. Specifically, they request the court to order France to: 

1.	Take proper measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere - in due proportion considering global emissions, and taking into account the particular responsibility accepted by developed countries - at a level compatible with the objective to contain the rise of the average temperature of the planet below the threshold of 1.5 C compared to pre-industrial levels; 
2.	Take, at least, all necessary measures to achieve France's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency; 
3.	Take the necessary measures to adapt the national territory to the effects of climate change; 
4.	Take the necessary measures to protect citizens lives and health from the risks of climate change. 

They further request compensation for the damages suffered as a result of the States failure to tackle climate change to be paid as the symbolic sum of 1 euro for their moral prejudice. 
 
According to a translation of the legal request, plaintiffs argue that the government has both general and specific legal duties to act on climate change. Its general duties stem from 1) the French Charter for the Environment (the Charter), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR), and 3) the general principle of law providing the right of every person to live in a preserved climate system. Under the Charter, plaintiffs point to citizens constitutional rights to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment and argue the government has a duty of care to take all necessary measures to identify, avoid, reduce and compensate the consequences of climate change. Like other recent international cases, they point to further obligations of the state to act on climate change to uphold the rights guaranteed under Articles 2 & 8 of the ECPHR, respectively the right to life and the right to respect for private and family life. They argue that these rights require States to implement a legislative and regulatory framework and to adopt practical measures meant to fight efficiently against climate change. 

Plaintiffs further base their claims on a  general principle of law providing a right to a preserved climate system which they argue stems from national law (such as the preamble of the Charter for the Environment, article L. 110-1 of the French Environment Code, etc.) and international law (the Stockholm Declaration, the World Charter for Nature, the Rio Declaration, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Climate action and renewable energy package for 2020, the Decision n406/2009/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 23 April 2009). Plaintiffs additionally argue the State has further specific obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under EU and national law as well as specific obligations to take action to prepare for the impacts of climate change on France.

On June 23, 2020 the government responded. According to the plaintiffs, the government asserted that it was taking action to address greenhouse gas emissions, and that the time has not elapsed for it to meet its 2020 goals. 

The case was heard in court on January 14, 2020. At the hearing the public rapporteur (independant consultant judge who provides an opinion to help guide the court's decision) issued an opinion. According to the plaintiffs, the opinion urged the court to recognize the fault of the French government, to recognize climate change as pure ecological damage, to award damages of one euro for moral prejudice, but to stop short of issuing an injunction because past damage cannot be repaired.

On February 3, 2021, the Administrative Court of Paris issued a decision recognizing that France's inaction has caused ecological damage from climate change and awarded the plaintiffs the requested one euro for moral prejudice caused by this inaction. The Court deferred the decision on whether to issue an injunction to order the French government to take stronger climate measures, and ordered the government to disclose steps it was taking to meet its climate targets within two months. As part of the decision, the Court held that France could be held responsible for failing to meet its own climate and carbon budget goals under EU and national law. But the Court rejected arguments that the government could be forced to meet more specific renewable energy and energy efficiency targets on the grounds that such sectoral measures cannot be independently directly linked to ecological damage. Further, the Court declined to issue compensatory damages for ecological harm, as the Court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that the government will be unable to repair the harm caused. 

On October 14, 2021, the administrative court of Paris ordered the State to take immediate and concrete actions to comply with its commitments on cutting carbon emissions and repair the damages caused by its inaction by December 31, 2022. The court determined that France emitted 62 million extra tonnes of emissions from 2015-2018, though it lowered the amount to 15 million tonnes, taking into account the drop in emissions in 2020. The court thus called on France to subtract the emissions caused in excess of its legislative commitments, adding these to the reduction of emissions planned between 2021 and 2022. France has committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Any future slippage of emissions beyond the legislative commitments must also be compensated. The court rejected a request to have France to pay 78 million euros per semester of delay in meeting the emissions goals, and said it is up to the Prime minister and the government to come up with the measures to fix the problem.",Decided,['France>Administrative Court of Paris'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other']","['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'France>Constitution', 'France>French Environmental Code', 'France>French Environmental Charter', 'European Convention on Human Rights']",Whether the French governments failure to take further action on climate change violates a statutory duty to act under domestic and international law,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/notre-affaire-a-tous-and-others-v-france/
Ontario v. Canada re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act,"The Province of Ontario filed suit in the Ontario Court of Appeal seeking consideration of whether the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) is unconstitutional. The GGPPA became law in June 2018 and, as its name implies, allows the national government to set a price on greenhouse gas emissions which will be applied to provinces and territories that have not implemented a compliant program once the law goes into effect in January 2019. Ontario alleged that Parliament exceeded its constitutional authority in passing the GGPPA, arguing that the GGPPA is not authorized by the national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power because the provinces are capable of regulating greenhouse gas emissions themselves and that there is no need to expand the scope of federal jurisdiction to impose a one-size-fits-all federal carbon price. Ontario further argues that even if the GGPPA falls within the scope of a national concern, the GGPPA represents an unconstitutional tax because it does not provide an adequate nexus between the charges it imposes and its regulatory purpose.  

Multiple parties have intervened in the case, including a number of advocacy groups and the governments of Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and British Columbia.

On June 28, 2019, the court upheld the constitutionality of the GGPPA. This decision marks the second decision among four provincial cases challenging the constitutionality of the GGPPA and the federal carbon pricing regime. The court determined that the GGPPA was constitutional under Parliaments power over matters of national concern to the peace, order, and good government of Canada. The court characterized the GGPPA as validly establishing minimum national standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This is broader than the Saskatchewan Court of Appeals characterization of the GGPPA as validly establishing minimum national GHG emissions pricing standards to reduce GHG emissions.  The Court of Appeal for Ontario also upheld both the large emitters output-based performance system (Part 2 of the Act), and the fuel levies (Part 1 of the Act), which it construed as a regulatory charge rather than a tax.

Friends of the Irish Environment v. Ireland,"An advocacy group, Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE), filed suit in the High Court, arguing that the Irish governments approval of the National Mitigation Plan in 2017 violated Irelands Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (""the Act""), the Constitution of Ireland, and obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly the right to life and the right to private and family life. FIE alleged that the National Mitigation Plan (""the Plan""), which seeks to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050, is inconsistent with the Act and Ireland's human rights commitments because it is not designed to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions. The case was argued before the High Court on January 22, 2019. FIE asked the High Court to quash the government's decision to approve the Plan and, if appropriate, order that a new plan be written.  

On September 19, 2019, the Court ruled for the government.  The Court rejected FEI's claim that the Plan was invalid for failing to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions, concluding that the Act does not require particular intermediate targets.  The Court recognized that ""there is now limited room, or . . . carbon budget, for greenhouse gas emissions"" given the ""safe temperature rise target"" of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The Court reasoned, however, that the government appropriately exercised policy making discretion afforded by the Act, explaining that the current Plan is only an initial step in achieving targets for transitioning to a low-carbon, climate resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, and will be subject to review and revision.  The Court concluded that FEI had standing to bring rights-based claims, but rejected the argument that the government had violated Ireland's Constitution and commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights because the Plan is ""but one, albeit extremely important, piece of the jigsaw."" 

On November 22, 2019, FEI appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal. FEI also submitted an application to leapfrog the traditional appeal route and go directly to the Supreme Court.  On February 13, 2020 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, determining that exceptional circumstances warranted direct appeal.  The Court explained that, ""[t]he applicant and the respondents accept that there exists a degree of urgency in respect of the adoption of remedial environmental measures.  There is no dispute between the parties as to the science underpinning the Plan and the likely increase in greenhouse emissions over the lifetime of the Plan.""

On July 31, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and issued a ruling quashing the Plan. The Court determined that the Plan falls short of the sort of specificity that the Act requires because a reasonable reader of the Plan would not understand how Ireland will achieve its 2050 goals. The Court explained that ""a compliant plan must be sufficiently specific as to policy over the whole period to 2050."" The Court, however, determined that FIE lacks standing to bring its claims under the Constitution or ECHR. The Court also concluded that FIE had not made a compelling enough case for identifying an unenumerated right to a healthy environment, separate from the rights expressly conferred by the Irish Constitution, ""[w]hile not ruling out the possibility that constitutional rights and obligations may well be engaged in the environmental field in an appropriate case."".",Decided,['Ireland>High Court of Ireland'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading']","['Ireland>Constitution', 'Ireland>Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015', 'European Convention on Human Rights']","Whether Irelands National Mitigation Plan violated statutory law, the Irish Constitution, and human rights obligations because it is not set to reduce greenhouse gas emissions sufficiently over the near-term.

Gloucester Resources Limited v. Minister for Planning,"On December 19, 2017, Gloucester Resources Limited sued the Minister of Planning, appealing the denial of the companys application to construct an open cut coal mine in New South Wales, the Rocky Hill Coal Project, which proposed to produce 21 million tonnes of coal over a period of 16 years. The Land & Environment Court of New South Wales upheld the governments denial of the application. The court found that the project was not in the public interest after weighing costs and benefits of the project, including the climate change impacts of the mines direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Under Section 4.15(1) of the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act (the EPA), the government is to consider the public interest as part of its review of a development application.

The Department of Planning denied the Rocky Hill Coal Project application in December 2017. After Gloucester Resources Limited appealed the decision, a local community action group called Gloucester Groundswell Inc. was joined to the litigation. The Minister and Groundswell argued that the Rocky Hill Project application should be denied due to the: 
1) incompatibility of the proposed mine with the existing, approved and likely preferred uses of nearby land; 
2) the adverse visual impacts of the mine; 
3) the adverse social impacts of the mine; 
4) the uncertainty surrounding the economic and public benefits of the mine which were not shown to be greater than the public costs of the mine; and 
5) the Rocky Hill Coal Project is not in the public interest because of the matters in (1) to (4) above and it is contrary to the principles of ecologically sustainable development because the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions of the mine will contribute to climate change.

As part of its consideration of climate change impacts, the court held that both upstream and downstream emissions of the project should be considered by the Planning Department because the EPA and its regulations require consideration of the principles of ecologically sustainable development (ESD) which can encompass climate change impacts. The court also pointed to the requirements under the EPA to consider any environmental planning instrument and cited language in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) of 2009 and the 2010 Gloucester Local Environmental Plan as including consideration of ESD and the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions associated with a project. The court recognized the link between these emissions and climate change, remaining unpersuaded by petitioners arguments related to market substitution, carbon leakage, the theoretical possibility that other projects would offset these emissions, and the inefficiency of this denial as a mechanism for global abatement of emissions. 

After weighing the costs and benefits of the project, the court upheld the governments denial of the application, finding that the negative impacts of the Project, including the planning impacts on the existing, approved and likely preferred land uses, the visual impacts, the amenity impacts of noise and dust that cause social impacts, other social impacts, and climate change impacts, outweigh the economic and other public benefits of the Project. While not foreclosing all mining projects, the court ruled that this project was not a sustainable use because of the combination of climate change impacts of the project and the high environmental and social costs of locating a coal mine in this particular location. 

Gloucester Resources Limited did not file an appeal by the court-designated deadline of May 8, 2019.

EU Biomass Plaintiffs v. European Union,"On Monday, March 4th, 2019, plaintiffs from six countries filed suit against the European Union in the European General Court in Luxembourg to challenge the treatment of forest biomass as a renewable fuel in the European Unions 2018 revised Renewable Energy Directive (known as RED II). RED II requires EU Member States to achieve an EU-wide target of 32% energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030. The plaintiffs allege that RED II will accelerate widespread forest devastation and significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions by not counting CO2 emissions from burning wood fuels. 

Plaintiffs describe the lawsuit as documenting the environmental, societal, and public health impacts associated with the increased logging, wood pellet manufacturing, and production of biomass energy driven by the RED II forest biomass policy. They allege that the policy is incompatible with the environmental objectives of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and violates the EU Charter on Fundamental Rights (Art. 32 and 57).The plaintiffs are a group of individuals and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from Estonia, Ireland, France, Romania, Slovakia, and the United States. The case also may be found under the name Sabo and Others v Parliament and Council. 

On May 6, 2020, the Court dismissed the case on standing grounds, reasoning that the directive is an act of general application, the applicants are not in a situation different from an indeterminate and indeterminable body of EU citizens, and therefore the directive is not of individual concern to them. Plaintiffs appealed to the Court of Justice of the EU.

On January 14, 2021, the Court of Justice rejected the appeal, upholding the lower court decision dismissing the case on standing grounds. The Court of Justice reasoned that the lower court made no error in law in concluding that plaintiffs had not demonstrated that the directive was of individual concern to them.",Pending,"['European Union>European Court of Justice', 'European Union>General Court (known as Court of First Instance before 2010)']","['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems']","['European Union>Primary Law>EU Charter on Human Rights', 'European Union>Primary Law>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2018 Revised Renewable Energy Directive']",Whether the European Unions 2018 revised Renewable Energy Directive illegally treats forest biomass as a renewable fuel by not counting CO2 emissions from burning wood fuels,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/eu-biomass-plaintiffs-v-european-union/
Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc.,"On April 5th, 2019, the environmental group Milieudefensie/Friends of the Earth Netherlands and co-plaintiffs served Shell a court summons alleging Shells contributions to climate change violate its duty of care under Dutch law and human rights obligations. The case was filed in the Hague District Court. Co-plaintiffs include other NGOs (ActionAid NL, Both ENDS, Fossielvrij NL, Greenpeace NL, Young Friends of the Earth NL, Waddenvereniging) and more than 17000 citizens. The plaintiffs seek a ruling from the court that Shell must reduce its CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 levels and to zero by 2050, in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. 

This case builds on the landmark Urgenda decision which found that the Dutch governments inadequate action on climate change violated a duty of care to its citizens. In the suit against Shell, plaintiffs extend this argument to private companies, arguing that given the Paris Agreements goals and the scientific evidence regarding the dangers of climate change, Shell has a duty of care to take action to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions. Plaintiffs base this duty of care argument on Article 6:162 of the Dutch Civil Code as further informed by Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) which guarantee rights to life (Article 2) and rights to a private life, family life, home, and correspondence (Article 8). Plaintiffs argument outlines how Shells long knowledge of climate change, misleading statements on climate change, and inadequate action to reduce climate change help support a finding of Shells unlawful endangerment of Dutch citizens and actions constituting hazardous negligence. 

In November 2019, Shell submitted a Statement of Defense. Shell argued, among other defenses, that there is no legal standard, statutory or otherwise, that would establish that Shell is acting in conflict with an unwritten legal standard by failing to comply with emissions caps. Shell also argued that plaintiffs' claims are too general to fall within the scope of ECHR Articles 2 and 8. 

In September and October 2020, the parties provided their evidence for factual and legal justification. Four days of hearings were then held on 1, 3, 15 and 17 December 2020. Documents from the hearings are available <a href=""https://en.milieudefensie.nl/news/overview-of-legal-documents-climatecase-against-shell"">here</a>. 

On May 26, 2021, the Hague District Court ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019, across all activities including both its own emissions and end-use emissions. The Court wrote that it ""orders [Royal Dutch Shell (RDS)], both directly and via the companies and legal entities it commonly includes in its consolidated annual accounts and with which it jointly forms the Shell group, to limit or cause to be limited the aggregate annual volume of all CO2 emissions into the atmosphere (Scope 1, 2 and 3) due to the business operations and sold energy-carrying products of the Shell group to such an extent that this volume will have reduced by at least net 45% at end 2030, relative to 2019 levels."" In other words, the Court ordered Shell to reduce emissions by a net 45% across both emissions from its own operations and emissions from the use of the oil it produces. The Court made its decision provisionally enforceable, meaning Shell will be required to meet its reduction obligations even as the case is appealed. 

In its decision, the Court allowed the class action by Milieudefensie, Greenpeace NL, Fossielvrij NL, Waddenvereniging, Both ENDS, and Young Friends of the Earth NL because the interests served in the class action aligned with the objectives stated in their articles of association. The Court rejected claims by ActionAid, because its operations were not geared toward Dutch citizens, and individual claimants, because their interests were already served by the class action and they did not present independent interests.

The Court wrote ""RDS reduction obligation ensues from the unwritten standard of care laid down in Book 6 Section 162 Dutch Civil Code, which means that acting in conflict with what is generally accepted according to unwritten law is unlawful."" Plaintiffs had argued that, stemming from this standard of care, Shell had an obligation to prevent dangerous climate change through its policies, and the Court applied the standard of care to the company's policies, emissions, consequences of its emissions, and its human rights and international and regional legal obligations. The Court concluded that the standard of care included the need for companies to take responsibility for Scope 3 emissions, especially ""where these emissions form the majority of a companys CO2 emissions, as is the case for companies that produce and sell fossil fuels.""

In applying this standard of care to Shell, the Court concluded that it must reduce its Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, across its entire energy portfolio, by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019 emission levels. The Court gave Shell flexibility in allocating emissions cuts between Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions, so long as in aggregate, the total emissions were reduced by 45%. The Court wrote, ""With respect to the business relations of the Shell group, including the end-users, this constitutes a significant best-efforts obligation, in which context RDS may be expected to take the necessary steps to remove or prevent the serious risks ensuing from the CO2 emissions generated by them, and to use its influence to limit any lasting consequences as much as possible. A consequence of this significant obligation may be that RDS will forgo new investments in the extraction of fossil fuels and/or will limit its production of fossil resources.""

The Court rejected arguments by Shell that the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) preempted further emissions cuts ordered by the court, and arguments that the reduction obligation would have no effect. The Court rejected the ETS argument on the grounds that the ETS only applies to some of the emissions in Europe Shell is responsible for, and the ETS does not cover emissions outside the EU. The standard of care, on the other hand, requires Shell to reduce all global emissions that will harm Dutch citizens. Further, the Court rejected the claim that a reduction obligation would have no effect because such emissions would be substituted by other companies. The Court wrote that it remains to be seen whether other companies will substitute Shell production in the face of Paris Agreement obligations and noted the causal relationship between production limitation and emissions reduction. The Court wrote, ""The court acknowledges that RDS cannot solve this global problem on its own. However, this does not absolve RDS of its individual partial responsibility to do its part regarding the emissions of the Shell group, which it can control and influence.""

On July 20, 2022, Shell appealed the decision.  

On April 25, 2022, Milieudefensie sent a letter to Shells Board of Directors calling for urgent action to comply with the verdict of May 26, 2021 and warning for personal liability risks towards third parties resulting from a failure to act.

Commune de Grande-Synthe v. France,"By three letters dated November 19, 2018, the municipality of Grande-Synthe and its mayor asked the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Minister of State, and the Minister of Ecological Transition and Solidarity to (i) take any useful measure to bend the curve of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced on the national territory to respect the obligations agreed by France; (ii) take all legislative or regulatory initiatives to ""make climate priority mandatory"" and to prohibit any measure likely to increase GHG emissions, and (iii) implement immediate measures to adapt to climate change in France. They did not receive any answer from the public authorities. 

Therefore, on January 23, 2019, they sued the French government and requested the Council of State to annul for excess of power the implicit decisions of rejection resulting from the silence kept by the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister of State, Minister of Ecological Transition and Solidarity, on their requests, and to order them to (i) take all necessary measures to curb the curve of GHG emissions produced on the national territory to respect at least the commitments agreed by France at the international and national levels; (ii) implement immediate measures to adapt to climate change in France, and (iii) take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to ""make climate change a priority"" and prohibit any measure likely to increase GHG emissions. The suit was filed before the Council of State (Conseil d'Etat), the highest administrative court in France, which has jurisdiction to review a decision within the general regulatory power of the government. Plaintiffs stressed the particular vulnerability of Grande-Synthe to the impacts of climate change as a low-lying coastal municipality exposed to sea level rise and flooding. 

On November 19, 2020, the Council of State ruled that the case was admissible. According to the Court, the coastal communities' claims are admissible in part because the city is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. The Court also accepted interventions by NGOs and other interested cities. The Court then noted that France committed itself to a 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and instructed the government to justify its ability to meet this goal without stricter measures. Although the Court signalled that the decision would be driven by French and European law and not the Paris Agreement, the Court reasoned that the Paris Agreement must be considered in the interpretation of national law. In this respect, the objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 set out in Article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code, which expressly mentions the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, is intended to ensure, as far as France is concerned, the effective implementation of the principles set out in international law. Moreover, the Court stated that the fact that the executive branch refrains from submitting a bill to Parliament concerns the relationship between the constitutional public authorities and is therefore outside the jurisdiction of the administrative court. On the other hand, it affirmed that it did not have all the necessary elements to assess the situation in order to state on the claim concerning the annulment of the implicit refusal to take any useful measure enabling the curve of GHG emissions produced on the national territory to be curbed and the related injunction to curb the emissions and instructed the government to justify, within three months, that it was taking adequate actions towards meeting its own 2030 climate goals. 

The Council of State issued the final decision on July 1, 2021. It ordered the government to ""take all the measures necessary"" by the end of March 2022 to bend the curve of GHG emissions to meet climate goals, including a 40% reduction by 2030. The Court annulled the government's implicit refusal to take necessary measures, noting that the emissions decrease in 2019 and 2020 were not enough to ensure compliance with the required climate goals, and current climate regulations were insufficient to meet the target. 

The procedure concerning the evaluation of the implementation of the measures necessary to comply with the decision of the Council of State is currently ongoing.

Saskatchewan et al. v. Canada re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act,"In April of 2018, the Province of Saskatchewan filed a reference case with the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, asking whether the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) was an unconstitutional intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. The GGPPA was introduced into Parliament on March 28, 2018 as Part 5 of Bill C-74 and became law on June 21, 2018. It established a federal price on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, effective as of January 2019, in any province or territory that has not implemented a compliant carbon pricing regime or any province or territory that requests it. The Paris Agreement was among the laws discussed in the preamble of the GGPPA in regard to the need for a carbon pricing mechanism. On May 3, 2019, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ruled that the (GGPPA) is constitutional in whole or in part by a 3-2 majority.

The Court of Appeal rejected Canadas broader argument that Parliament has jurisdiction over the cumulative dimensions of GHG emissions under the national concern branch of its Peace, Order, and good Government [POGG] power. The Court found this approach would exceed the constitutional authority of Parliament and intrude too far into areas of Provincial authority and limit Provincial efforts to deal with GHG emissions. However, the Court did rule that Parliament has more narrow authority under the POGG to establish minimum national standards of price stringency for GHG emissions because this authority has the singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility required by the law. Accordingly, the Court ruled that the GGPPA is constitutionally valid under this more narrow POGG authority.

The Attorney General for Saskatchewan appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In similar cases, the Court of Appeal of Ontario had also ruled the Act constitutional, while the Court of Appeal of Alberta had ruled it unconstitutional. Both were also appealed and the three cases were heard together before the Supreme Court. 

On March 25, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected Saskatchewan and Ontario's appeals and upheld the GGPPA as constitutional in a 6-3 decision. The Court upheld the Act under the POGG power of the constitution, reasoning that climate change was of sufficient national concern to warrant federal jurisdiction, provinces had a constitutional inability to set national GHG emission reduction standards, and the Act's impact on provincial jurisdiction is qualified and limited. The Court wrote that ""Canada has adduced evidence that clearly shows that establishing minimum national standards of GHG price stringency to reduce GHG emissions is of sufficient concern to Canada as a whole that it warrants consideration in accordance with the national concern doctrine."" Provinces were incapable of addressing the problem in the same way because they could not set a national minimum GHG price, and ""a failure to include one province in the scheme would jeopardize its success in the rest of Canada."" Further, the Court found that the GGPPA had a limited effect on provincial jurisdiction because it was limited to a narrow regulatory mechanism of pricing, not regulation of all aspects of GHG emissions, and because it only acts as a backstop if provincial pricing is found insufficient.

Daniel Billy and others v Australia (Torres Strait Islanders Petition),"A group of eight Torres Strait Islanders, Australian nationals, and six of their children submitted a petition against the Australian government to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. They are all indigenous inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig, four small, low-lying islands in Australias Torres Strait region. The Islanders claimed that changes in weather patterns have direct harmful consequences on their livelihood, their culture and traditional way of life. The Islanders indicated that severe flooding caused by the tidal surge in recent years has destroyed family graves and left human remains scattered across their islands. They argued that maintaining ancestral graveyards and visiting and communicating with deceased relatives are at the heart of their cultures. In addition, the most important ceremonies, such as coming-of-age and initiation ceremonies, are only culturally meaningful if performed in the community's native lands. The Islanders also argued that changes in climate with heavy rainfall and storms have degraded the land and trees and have consequently reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming. On Masig Island, for example, the rising sea level has caused saltwater to seep into the soil and coconut trees to become diseased, subsequently killing off the fruit, and its coconut water, which are part of the Islanders traditional diet.

The Islanders claimed their rights had been violated as Australia failed to adapt to climate change by, inter alia, upgrading seawalls on the islands and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The petition alleges that Australia is violating the plaintiffs fundamental human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) due to the governments failure to address climate change. This petition represents the first climate change legal action in Australia that makes an argument based on a violation of human rights. It also constitutes the first legal action filed with a UN body by inhabitants of low-lying islands against a national government for inaction on climate change.

The plaintiffs inhabit a group of islands off the northern tip of Queensland, Australia, between the Australian mainland and Papua New Guinea. These low-lying island communities are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts including sea level rise, storm surge, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification. According to materials released by the plaintiffs, the complaint alleges that Australias insufficient action on climate change has violated the following rights under the ICCPR: Article 27 (the right to culture), Article 17 (the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home), and Article 6 (the right to life). The complaint further argues these violations stem from both insufficient targets and plans to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and inadequate funding for coastal defense and resilience measures on the islands, such as seawalls. 

On August 13, 2020, Australia asked the Committee to dismiss the petition.

On September 23, 2022, the U.N. Human Rights Committee found that Australias failure to adequately protect indigenous Torres Islanders against adverse impacts of climate change violated their rights to enjoy their culture and be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family and home. The Committee took into account the Islanders spiritual connection with their traditional lands, and the dependence of their cultural integrity on the health of their surrounding ecosystems. It therefore found that Australias failure to take timely and adequate measures to protect the indigenous Islanders against adverse climate change impacts led to the violation of their rights to enjoy their own culture and to be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family and home. The Committee indicated that despite Australias series of actions, such as the construction of new seawalls on the four islands that are expected to be completed by 2023, additional timely and appropriate measures were required to avert a risk to the Islanders lives, since without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change may expose individuals to a violation of their right to life under the Covenant. As remedies, the Committee asked Australia to compensate the indigenous Islanders for the harm suffered, engage in meaningful consultations with their communities to assess their needs, and take measures to continue to secure the communities safe existence on their respective islands.",Decided,['United Nations>United Nations Human Rights Committee'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Indigenous Groups']",['International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights'],Whether Australia violated the human rights of low-lying islanders through failure to act on climate change,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/petition-of-torres-strait-islanders-to-the-united-nations-human-rights-committee-alleging-violations-stemming-from-australias-inaction-on-climate-change/
Notre Affaire a Tous and Others v. Total,"The French NGOs Notre Affaire a Tous, Sherpa, Zea, and Les Eco Maires along with more than a dozen French local governments have taken the first step in a legal proceeding against French oil company and carbon major Total. The initiative seeks a court order forcing Total to issue a corporate strategy that 1) identifies the risks resulting from GHG emissions resulting from the use of goods and services that Total produces, 2) identifies the risks of serious climate-related harms as outlined in the 2018 IPCC special report, and 3) undertakes action to ensure the companys activities align with a trajectory compatible with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. The plaintiffs argue these obligations stem from domestic law Article L. 225-102-4.-I of the Commercial Code (Loi 27 Mars 2017 sur le devoir de vigilance des societes meres et des entreprises donneuses d'ordre). This law requires a company to produce a ""plan of vigilance"" that identifies and seeks to mitigate risks to human rights, fundamental freedoms, the environment, and public health that could result directly or indirectly from the operations of the company and of the companies it controls.

On June 18th, 2019, following a formal meeting with Total, the plaintiffs announced the launch of a legal proceeding and issued a letter of formal notice (mise en demeure) to Total. Plaintiffs asserted that Total had 3 months to include adequate GHG emissions reductions targets in its latest plan de vigilance before they filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to force the company to comply with the law and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.

On January 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed a complaint asking a Nanterre court to order Total to recognize the risks generated by its business activities and make it conduct consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5C. According to the plaintiffs, their complaint relies on the Law on the Duty of Vigilance, as well as the duty of environmental vigilance arising out of the the French Environmental Charter. The plaintiffs allege that Total didn't provide enough detailed information in its vigilance plan for reducing its emissions and the company is still not in line with international climate agreements.

Total did not respond to the merits and requested that the case be brought before the commercial court. On February 11, 2021, the pre-trial judge rejected Total's objection of incompetence and confirmed the jurisdiction of the judicial court. The judge considers that the NGOs have, as non-traders, a right of option, which they exercise at their convenience, between the judicial court, which they have validly seized, and the commercial court. On November 18, 2021, the Versailles Court of Appeal confirmed the jurisdiction of the Nanterre judicial court to settle the dispute. The decision is based on the exclusive jurisdiction of certain courts of law in matters of cessation and compensation for ecological damage.

On July 21, 2022, the City of New York intervened in support of the Plaintiffs in the current litigation through an intervention volontaire accessoire. The City of New York has based its intervention on the significant interest it has in engaging  locally and globally  in efforts to mitigate climate change, also because of the severe damages and risks this phenomenon causes to the City.

On July 6, 2023, the pre-trial judge dismissed the preventive lawsuit for procedural reasons after several years of successful litigation on the Civil court's jurisdiction. The Paris first instance court also refused to examine the impact of TotalEnergies' activities on climate change. 
The judge deems the lack of strict identity between the demands in the formal notice demands and summons as an inadmissibility ground. In addition, the judge believes no plaintiff has standing concerning climate change since it is a worldwide issue. Although it is a classical issue in climate litigation, the pre-trial judge's position clearly contradicts the French Admin Supreme Court finding in climate cases against the State (see paras 4 - 7 on standing).

"Michael Mann v. Timothy (Tim) Ball, The Frontier Centre for Public Policy, Inc. and John Doe","In 2011, climate scientist Michael Mann filed a libel claim against Timothy (Tim) Ball, The Frontier Centre for Public Policy, Inc. (""FCPP""), and an unnamed defendant (""John Doe""). The defendant Ball participated in an interview with the FCPP and John Doe during which Ball made allegedly false and defamatory statements inferring that Michael Mann is guilty of criminal fraud in relation to the alleged Climategate scandal or alternatively that there are probably grounds to find Mann guilty. The plaintiff sought damages, an injunction against further publication of the defamatory statements, and a court order for the defendants to remove the interview containing the defamatory statements from all electronic databases, including the FCPP website. In June 2019, the FCPP settled with Mann and issued a retraction and apology on their website. 

On August 22, 2019, the court dismissed the case on account of delay. The court found that two periods of delay totalling 35 months constituted ""inordinate delay"" that could not be excused on account of the plaintiff being occupied with other matters. The court further found that this delay had caused prejudice to the defendant because three of the defendants' planned witnesses had died.

Maria Khan et al. v. Federation of Pakistan et al.,"A coalition of women filed a constitutional petition on their behalf and on behalf of future generations against the Federation of Pakistan. They allege that the federal governments inaction on climate change violated their fundamental rights including the right to a clean and healthy environment and a climate capable of sustaining human life, (a right which was previously recognized in Asghar Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan 2018 CLD 424). They further argue that since climate change has a disproportionate impact on women, the governments climate inaction violates plaintiffs rights to equal protection under the law and no discrimination on the basis of sex.  

Plaintiffs explain that the government specifically has failed to prioritize clean energy projects, even though solar and wind energy has become cheaper than conventional energy, and has not approved any clean energy projects between December 2017 and the filing of the suit. Plaintiffs argue this failure to abate greenhouse gas emissions violates the clear mandate of the RE Policy 2006, the firm commitments made by the State of Pakistan pursuant to the Paris Agreement and the urgent threat of climate change. Plaintiffs further argue these violations amount to violations of constitutional rights. They state that the superior courts of Pakistan have held that Fundamental Rights like the right to life and security of person under Articles 4 and 9 [of the constitution] include the right to a healthy and clean environment, and have also read the right to human dignity under Article 14 with the constitutional principles of democracy, equality, social, economic and political justice including within their ambit the international environmental principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, environmental impact assessment, inter and intragenerational equity and public trust doctrine.

Emissions reductions in the energy sector were critical, according to the petitioners, as the sector was responsible for 47% of Pakistans total emissions. In Pakistans 2016 NDC, the government committed to a 20% reduction of its 2030 projected GHG emissions. Despite this, petitioners maintained that respondents had neither prioritized clean energy projects nor approved a renewable energy project since December 2017. The petitioners alleged that this failure betrayed the governments stated commitment under the Paris Agreement to encourage and foster the development of renewable energy sources. Khan et al. also argued that the respondents violated the public trust doctrine and principle of intergenerational equity, as well as the concept of climate justice developed in Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan. The petitioners sought orders declaring that the government must support renewable energy projects and enforce the Paris Agreement in letter and spirit.

Save Lamu et al. v. National Environmental Management Authority and Amu Power Co. Ltd.,"Kenyas National Environmental Tribunal (the Tribunal) set aside the issuance of a license by the National Environmental Management Authority (NEMA) to Amu Power Company for the construction of the Lamu Coal-fired Power Plant (Lamu Plant). The Lamu Plant would be the first coal-fired power plant in Kenya. The Tribunal found that the National Environmental Management Authority violated the Environmental Impact Assessment & Audit Regulations (EIA Regulations) by granting an Environmental Impact Assessment License without proper and meaningful public participation in the process.  

Additionally, the Tribunal found that the Amu Power Companys Environmental & Social Impact Assessment was incomplete and scientifically insufficient in violation of the regulations. Applying the precautionary principle, the Tribunal found one of the insufficiencies of the assessment was the inadequate consideration of climate change and the Climate Change Act of 2016. The Tribunal ordered the Amu Power Company, if it should choose to pursue the project, to conduct a new EIA study in compliance with the EIA Regulations. The Tribunal further instructed the Amu Power Company that the new EIA study must include all approved and legible detailed architectural and engineering plans for the plant and its ancillary facilities (such as the coal storage and handling facility and the ash pit with its location in relation to the sea shore), consideration of the Climate Change Act 2016, the Energy Act 2019 and the Natural Resources (Classes of Transactions subject to Ratification) Act 2016 in so far as the project will utilise sea water for the plant and/ or if applicable.

ExxonMobil v. Germany,"On March 10, 2016, ExxonMobil filed a challenge against Germany in the Verwaltungsgericht Berlin (Administrative Court, Berlin, Germany), concerning an application to the German Emissions Trading Authority (DEHSt) for the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances (ghg allowances) free of charge to a Exxon-owned natural gas processing installation in Germany which, among other activities, engages in sulphur recovery that by the combustion of fuels generates electricity and heat and releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The Administrative Court referred the case to the European Unions Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling interpreting the laws which establish a greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system with the European Union to determine whether this facility was entitled to ghg allowances free of charge.

On June 20, 2019, the Court of Justice ruled that part of Exxons natural gas processing plant in Germany should be classified as an electricity generator. The Court of Justice interpreted Article 3(u) and Article 10a of, and Annex I to, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (which established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the EU) and as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC (Directive 2003/87). It additionally interpreted Article 3(c) and (h) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU concerning rules for the temporary free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87. The court concluded that Article 3(u) of Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted to mean that an installation, such as that at issue in the proceedings, (which produces electricity through the combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20 [megawatts (MW)]), must be understood as an electricity generator when even a small portion of that electricity is continuously fed into the public electricity network (unless the product of the installation meets an exempted category in the annex). The installation in question could not be exempted even if its purpose was to produce electricity for the natural gas processing facility. The Court of Justice further determined that Article 3(c) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU must be interpreted to mean that an installation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not entitled to be allocated free emission allowances for the heat produced where that heat is used for purposes other than the production of electricity, since such an installation does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Article 10a(4) and (8) of the directive. The activities of natural gas desulphurisation and sulphur recovery did not meet the criteria of those articles.

An analyst reviewing the decision noted that if it is followed by EU governments, it could result in thousands of facilities no longer qualifying for free allocation of ghg emission permits and drive up the cost of carbon in the market.",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],"['European Union>Secondary Law>Regulations>Commission Decision 2011/278/EU', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2009/29/EC', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC']",Whether a company can receive a free allocation of emissions allowances in the EU greenhouse gas emission trading scheme for a certain type of installation at a natural gas processing facility,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/exxonmobil-v-germany/
Certain Activities Carried Out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua),"On November 18, 2010, Costa Rica filed an action against Nicaragua in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), alleging an incursion into, occupation of and use by Nicaraguas army of Costa Rican territory as well as [alleged] breaches of Nicaraguas obligations towards Costa Rica under a number of international treaties and conventions.  As part of this proceeding, Costa Rica sought compensation for the loss of environmental goods and services the country sustained due to Nicaraguas excavation of channels on its territory. Among the services for which Costa Rica sought compensation was the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration. On February 2, 2018, the ICJ ruled how much Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica for the loss of environmental services. This followed a ruling on the merits from December 16, 2015 that established that Nicaraguas activities were unlawful and violated Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty and navigational rights, as well as the Court's Order of 8 March 2011, and found that Costa Rica should be compensated for these unlawful activities.

Costa Rica argued that Nicaragua had, on two separate incidents, occupied the territory of Costa Rica in connection with the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory from the San Juan River to Laguna los Portillos (or Harbor Head Lagoon) and associated acts of dredging on the San Juan River. Nicaragua removed nearly 300 trees and cleared 6.19 hectares of vegetation in excavating the Costa Rican channels.  The Costa Rican government sought compensation for the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide environmental goods and services including gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration.  In ruling for Costa Rica, the ICJ reasoned that Nicaraguas activities significantly undermined the ability of the two areas to provide environmental goods and services.  Because this loss of environmental services was a direct result of Nicaraguas actions, the ICJ ruled that Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica US$120,000 for the impairment or loss of the environmental goods and services of the impacted area in the period prior to recovery. Furthermore, the ICJ did not consider that the impairment or loss of carbon sequestration services could be valued as a one- time loss. This was the first case wherein in ICJ adjudicated a claim for compensation for environmental damage.

Sheikh Asim Farooq v. Federation of Pakistan etc.,"Members of civil society filed suit against Pakistan, (impleading several departments including the Planning and Development Department, Punjab Environmental Protection Department, and Housing & Urban Development Department), for failure to plant, protect, manage, preserve, and conserve the trees and forests in Punjab in violation of statutory obligations and petitioners constitutional rights. Petitioners requested a writ of mandamus under Article 199 of Pakistans Constitution and alleged the governments conduct violated their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 9 (right of life liberty), Article 14 (right of dignity), Article 26 (right of access to public places of entertainment) and Article 38(b) (provision of available leisure places) of the Constitution. Petitioners asked the court, inter alia, to appraise the governments implementation of relevant policies to increase forest cover; to implement the Forest Act, 1927 (the Forest Act) and the Punjab Plantation and Maintenance of Trees Act, 1974 (the Trees Act) by planting trees; to present a timeline for implementation, and to initiate appropriate proceedings against officers who failed to discharge their duties.

The High Court of Lahore allowed the writ of mandamus, ordering the government to fulfill their obligations under the law to safely manage, conserve, sustain, maintain, protect and grow forests and plant trees in urban cities. The court summarized a variety of requirements under natural resource, development, local government, and international law to establish the governments obligations to protect the forest including the Forest Act and Trees Act. It directed the government to take its legal obligations seriously in implementing related policies, including the National Climate Change Policy, 2012, the National Forest Policy, 2015, the Forest Policy Statement, 1999 and Punjab Environment Policy, 2015. It noted that if the government had properly fulfilled its legal obligations in letter and spirit the forest of Pakistan could have been saved [from] further depletion and deforestation. In its discussion of relevant law, the court touched on the right to a healthy environment, the precautionary principle, and the public trust doctrine. Specifically, in regard to climate change, the court summarized the negative impacts of climate change on forests and obligations under the National Climate Change Policy, 2012 to protect biodiversity and prevent wetland degradation by reducing deforestation.

At the time of the decision, the involved government bodies had already prepared an Urban Trees Plantation Policy under direction of the court resulting in massive plantings across the Punjab area. In addition to instructions to implement the laws, the court order included instructions to the government bodies to consider revising requirements and penalties under the Trees Act, publish annual reports on expansion of the forest area, impose penalties against delinquent officers, and to issue directions to the housing societies and authorities to support the planting of trees in the green belt and issue penalties for cutting those trees down.

Claire Stephenson v. Secretary of State for Housing and Communities and Local Government,"Claimant, on behalf of the advocacy group Talk Fracking, successfully challenged a section of the UKs National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) that promoted fracking.  Claimant alleged that the section, known as paragraph 209(a), was developed without accounting for recent evidence of shale gas developments contribution to climate change. The Administrative Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court of Justice quashed paragraph 209(a).

Paragraph 209(a) instructed minerals planning authorities to recognize the benefits of developing oil and gas, including unconventional hydrocarbons, and to implement policies to facilitate their exploration and extraction.  The court concluded that the Secretary of State for Housing and Communities and Local Government acted unlawfully by failing to undertake a proper public consultation or to account for recent evidence of the climate impacts of shale gas development. The claimant also argued that paragraph 209(a) triggered the need to conduct a Strategic Environmental Assessment and ran afoul of the UKs commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions under the Climate Change Act of 2008, claims that the court rejected. On May 23, 2019, the Secretary issued a statement to remove paragraph 209(a), and the UK Government updated the NPPF on June 19.

"Sacchi, et al. v. Argentina, et al.","Sixteen children filed a petition alleging that Argentina, Brazil, France, Germany and Turkey violated their rights under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (the Convention) by making insufficient cuts to greenhouse gases and failing to encourage the worlds biggest emitters to curb carbon pollution.  The children ask the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (the Committee) to declare that respondents violated their rights by perpetuating climate change, and to recommend actions for respondents to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.  

Petitioners claim that climate change has led to violations of their rights under the Convention, including the rights to life, health, and the prioritization of the childs best interest, as well as the cultural rights of petitioners from indigenous communities.  For example, Deborah Adegbile of Nigeria asserts that she has been repeatedly hospitalized for asthma attacks triggered by rising temperatures and exacerbated smog.  Ellen-Anne of Sweden alleges that climate change imperils her indigenous communitys traditional reliance on reindeer husbandry and herding.  David Ackley III, Litokne Kabua, and Ranton Anjain of the Marshall Islands similarly claim that sea-level rise poses an existential threat to their culture.  

Each respondent has ratified the Convention.  All five have signed the Paris Agreement but, according to petitioners, none have made or kept commitments that align with keeping temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.  The petition asserts that respondents have four related obligations under the Convention: (i) to prevent foreseeable domestic and extraterritorial human rights violations resulting from climate change; (ii) to cooperate internationally in the face of the global climate emergency; (iii) to apply the precautionary principle to prevent deadly consequences even in the face of uncertainty; and (iv) to ensure intergenerational justice for children and posterity.  Petitioners allege that respondents have failed to prevent foreseeable human rights harms caused by climate change by making insufficient reductions to greenhouse gas emissions.  Petitioners further claim that as members of the G20, respondents have failed to use available legal, diplomatic, and economic tools to protect children from the greenhouse gas pollution of major emitters including China, the United Stations, the European Union and India.

The children request that the Committee make findings including that climate change is a childrens rights crisis, and that each respondent has caused and is perpetuating climate change by knowingly acting in disregard of available scientific evidence.  They also ask the Committee to recommend that the respondents review, and where necessary, amend their laws and policies to ensure that mitigation and adaptation efforts are accelerated; initiate cooperative international action to establish binding and enforceable climate measures; and ensure childrens right to be heard in all efforts to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis.  The Committee must determine if the petition is actionable before making findings or recommendations.   

Brazil, France and Germany responded to the petition, arguing that it was not admissible on three grounds: 1) the Committee lacks jurisdiction; 2) the petition is manifestly ill-founded or unsubstantiated; and 3) petitioners have not exhausted domestic remedies. On May 4, 2020, the petitioners filed a reply asserting that the petition is admissible. They argue: 1) that the Committee has jurisdiction because the children are ""directly and foreseeably injured by greenhouse gas emissions originating in Respondents' territory;"" 2) the claims are manifestly well-founded because the children are suffering direct and personal harms now and will continue to in the foreseeable future; and 3) that pursuing domestic remedies would be futile. 

On October 12, 2021, the CRC rejected the claim as inadmissible. The Committee accepted the claimant's arguments that States are legally responsible for the harmful effects of emissions originating in their territory on children outside their borders. The fact that all states are causing climate change does not absolve states of individual responsibility to reduce their own share of emissions. The Committee also found that the youth are victims of foreseeable threats to their rights to life, health, and culture. 

Following the reasoning of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR)  <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/request-advisory-opinion-inter-american-court-human-rights-concerning-interpretation-article-11-41-51-american-convention-human-rights/"">2017 advisory opinion</a>, the CRC found that countries have extraterritorial responsibilities related to carbon pollution. Using the IACtHR's test for jurisdiction, the Committee found that when transboundary harm occurs, children are under the jurisdiction of the State on whose territory the emissions originated if there is a causal link between the acts or omissions of the State in question and the negative impact on the rights of children located outside its territory, when the State of origin exercises effective control over the sources of the emissions in question. 

While the Committee said that the children had shown, for jurisdictional purposes, that the impairment of their rights as a result of the State partys acts or omissions regarding the carbon emissions originating within its territory was reasonably foreseeable, it held that the complaint was inadmissible for a failure to exhaust local remedies.

Take Down Macron Protester Cases,"In more than 35 trials, climate protestors across France have defended against theft and refusal to provide DNA charges stemming from their activities as part of the <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/11/climate-change-activists-trial-paris-stealing-macron-portraits"">""Take Down Macron""</a> movement. Defendants argued that they had stolen or attempted to steal portraits of the French President, Emmanuel Macron, in official city and government buildings out of necessity to call attention to France's failure to meet its climate targets. Judgments in the trials ranged from acquittals to fines of hundreds of Euros. Several of the judgments were appealed, with at least three cases reaching their final conclusion as of December 2020. Documents from six of the cases are available below. More documents will be added as they become available.

In one of the trials, in Lyon, two defendants were charged with fraudulently removing the portraits from a town hall in Lyon in February 2019. The prosecutor sought to impose a fine of 500 euros on each defendant. The court heard testimony from a former government minister that France has not complied with the Paris Agreement due to a lack of political will, and that only the president can order the action required by the present situation. An ecologist also testified about the necessity for rapid change in order to limit temperature rise. The defendants argued that the use of legal channels and warnings from scientific experts had not provided sufficient leverage, and they believed that acts of nonviolent civil disobedience were required to raise awareness of the need for policy change.

The court agreed, finding that climate change seriously affects the future of humanity by provoking natural disasters, leading to violent conflicts, and threatening flora and fauna; and that although France is committed to certain measures to address climate change, the defense's submissions showed that the government's objectives will not be achieved. The court concluded that, under these circumstances, citizens' means of expression could not be limited to voting, and that the defendants' theft of the portrait was a necessary substitute for impossible dialogue between the government and the people. The court accordingly acquitted both defendants. 

The prosecutor appealed the judgment, and the appeal hearing is set for December 19, 2020.

ClientEarth v. Polska Grupa Energetyczna,"In September 2019, environmental law organization ClientEarth brought a civil action against Polska Grupa Energetyczna Gornictwo i Energetyka Konwencjonalna S.A. (PGE GiEK S.A.). In the civil action, ClientEarth is requesting that the Regional Court for the city of odz order PGE GiEK S.A. to cease the use of lignite as a fuel for the production of energy at the Bechatow Power Plant. According to ClientEarths petition, of the 12 units currently in operation at the Bechatow Power Plant, 11 should be closed by 2030, with one being closed no later than by 2035.

ClientEarths claim is based on art. 323 cl. 1 and 2 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, which grants standing to environmental NGOs to file civil lawsuits against entities whose illegal actions either damage or threaten to damage the environment as a public good. 
ClientEarth alleges, inter alia, that in view of the fact that the Bechatow Power Plant is the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the European Union and has materially contributed to climate change, the alleged damage caused to the environment by this power station is of a scale which transcends any private interest and negatively impacts the general environment. ClientEarth also contends that this power plant has had a negative impact on other aspects of the environment, including the water and soil in the surrounding region. This environmental damage is directly linked to the use by the power station of lignite as a fuel and, therefore, in order to redress damage that has already occurred and prevent damage which will occur in the future if nothing changes, the use of lignite at this power station must cease as soon as possible.

While art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act has on occasion provided the legal basis for rare interventions, ClientEarths intervention (as far as ClientEarth is aware) is the first in Poland launched by an NGO for the protection of the environment as a public good in the context of climate change, and the first to use art. 323 as a basis for a court in Poland to order a change in a companys behavior. Owing to this, the case presents numerous novel legal issues, not least of which include: 
a)	the definition of illegal activity as understood in art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, particularly in the context of art. 325 of said act, which does not preclude permitted activity (i.e., conducted on the basis and within the parameters of an administrative permit) from being considered illegal under art. 323;
b)	the bounds of permissible demands under art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, and  related thereto  the issues of separation of powers under the Polish constitution, freedom of economic activity, and proportionality (i.e., whether a court can order the operator of a power plant to change the manner of operating the power plant, or whether this can only be done through a legislative process).

On September 22, 2020, the judge in the case ruled that PGE must negotiate with ClientEarth to attempt to reach a settlement within three months to swiftly reduce Belchatows climate impacts. According to ClientEarth, this marks the first time a Polish Court has required a coal plant to engage in such negotiations to reduce climate emissions. Negotiations between the parties, conducted as part of the court proceedings, did not bring any resolution. The case is pending, with the parties exchanging legal briefs and awaiting further developments.

Bitter v. Germany,"Claimant challenged the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme's (EU ETS) excess emissions penalty, imposed on operators that have not surrendered sufficient emissions allowances.  The European Court of Justice upheld the penalty.

German company Ziegelwerk Hoxter GmbH operated an installation releasing greenhouse gases until September 2011.  In November 2011 a German district court opened insolvency proceedings against the company, and Sandra Bitter was appointed insolvency administrator.  The German authorities requested that Bitter report and surrender emissions allowances for 2011 as required by the EU ETS, and Bitter responded that the company was not obligated to do so because it had ceased its business activity before the insolvency procedure began.  The government then imposed a fine of 100 euros per non-surrendered ton of carbon dioxide emissions equivalent, pursuant to Article 16(3) of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament.  Bitter challenged the decision in the Berlin administrative court, which in turn referred to the European Court of Justice the question of whether the 100-euro per ton fine violated the principle of proportionality under EU law.

The Court upheld the penalty, reasoning that the EU legislature must be allowed broad discretion when it is asked to intervene in an area that entails political, economic and social choices.  The Court relied on earlier decisions upholding a fine of 40 euros for non-surrendered allowances during the first phase of the EU ETS, in which the Court credited the legislature's determination that the fine was necessary to establish an efficient allowance trading system.  The Court further held that the fact that the instant penalty of 100 euros exceeded the one previously upheld was irrelevant, particularly because the first trading period of a ""learning period for the scheme.""",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],['European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC'],"Plaintiff challenged validity, under EU Emissions Trade Scheme, of 100-euro penalty per ton of carbon dioxide emitted for which the operator has not surrendered allowances.

Borealis et al. v. Environmental Protection Agency of Sweden,"Operators of greenhouse gas emitting installations challenged Swedish government's 2013 allocation of free allowances under Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council, which established the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).  The European Court of Justice answered a number of referred questions related to the proper calculation of free allowances for the hotel metal industry.  

During the third trading period of the EU ETS, from 2013-2020, sectors other than the electricity generation sector receive a limited number of emissions allowances for free (allowances in the electricity generation sector are all auctioned off).  In November 2013, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency determined the final amount of free emission allowances to be allocated for the third trading period of the EU ETS.  Eight operators of greenhouse gas emitting facilities brought an action to invalidate the decision, and a Swedish court referred a number of legal questions to the European Court of Justice.  The claimants first took issue with the correction factor that the EU had adopted according to Article 15(3) of Decision 2011/278 and set forth in Article 4 and Annex II of Decision 2013/448.  The correction factor is applied to set the number of free allowances allocated to non-electricity generators in the event that the bottom-up calculation of allowances exceeds the applicable cap.  The Court noted that it had recently invalidated the correction factor, and the EU was in the midst of revising it.

The claimants also argued that the benchmark for the hot metal industry was improper for a number of reasons.  Product benchmarks are reference values that determine how many free allowances each installation in a particular industry will receive.  Under Directive 2003/87, a product benchmark must be established based on the performance of the 10% most efficient installations in the sector.  In implementing this rule, the European Commission overestimated the performances of installations producing hot metal.  The Court held that the resulting benchmark did not exceed the Commission's discretion, explaining that the Commission had verified that its starting point sufficiently reflected the most efficient techniques available, and used appropriate reference documents where data could not be verified or did not comply with the benchmarking methodology. 

The claimants further challenged the treatment of waste gases produced by the hot metal sector. Under Decision 2011/278, the product benchmarks must take account of the efficient energy recovery of waste gases and emissions related to their use.  Under Article 15(3) of that Decision, where waste gases are exported from the production process outside the system boundaries of the relevant product benchmark and used to produce heat, related emissions should be taken into account for purposes of allocating allowances.  However, when such waste gases are used to produce electricity, additional allowances should not be allocated, in accordance with the principle that no free allowances should be allocated for electricity generation.  The Court upheld Article 15(3) as valid insofar as it excludes the taking into account of emissions from electricity generators for the purposes of determining the maximum annual amount of allowances.

The Court further determined that Decision 2011/278 permits a Member State to decline to allocate allowances to an operator for the consumption, in a heat benchmark sub-installation, of heat produced in a fuel benchmark sub-installation, based on the principle that emissions cannot be double-counted.  Similarly, the Court concluded, a Member State may decline to count emissions related to that exported heat when collecting data under the EU ETS, and may refuse to allocate free allowances for emissions related to the production of measurable heat by burning waste gases generated by a hot metal benchmark installation.  However, the Court held that the rule against double counting does not prohibit the allocation of free allowances on the basis of the heat benchmark for the combustion of waste gases, created during hot metal production, to supply heat to a district heating network. The Court reasoned that the Environmental Protection Agency had applied the heat benchmark in determining the amount of free allowances to be allocated, and considered emissions beyond the value set by the fuel benchmark to be taken into account under the hot metal benchmark. 

The Court remanded the case to the Swedish court for a final ruling consistent with its opinion.

Schaefer Kalk GmbH &amp; Co. KG v. Germany,"A German company operating a facility covered by the EU carbon emissions trading system argued that carbon dioxide that is transferred to a non-covered facility and becomes chemically bound - and is thus not released into the atmosphere - should not be considered ""emitted."" The European Court of Justice agreed, invalidating an EU regulation insofar as it systematically included carbon dioxide that becomes so chemically bound in the trading scheme regardless of whether that carbon dioxide is actually emitted into the atmosphere. 

Schaefer Kalk GmbH & Co. KG (Schaefer Kalk) operates an installation for the calcination of lime in Hahnstatten, Germany, which is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). During the lime calcination process carbon dioxide is emitted, which Schaefer Kalk transfers to an installation that is not covered by the EU ETS for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC).  In the process of getting its monitoring plan approved, Schaefer Kalk applied for authorization to subtract the carbon dioxide transferred for PCC production from the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the companys emissions report. Schaefer Kalk argued that the transferred carbon dioxide is chemically bound in the PCC and that, not being emitted into the atmosphere, it cannot be regarded as emissions as defined in Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87/EC.

The German Emissions Trading Authority at the Federal Environment Agency (DEHSt) approved the monitoring plan without addressing the issue of subtracting transferred carbon dioxide. Schaefer Kalk brought a complaint to the DEHSt, which was rejected. The DEHSt argued that subtraction was not legal under Article 49 of Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 and Annex IV thereto, which only provides that carbon dioxide transferred to one of the long-term geological storage installations listed in that article may be subtracted from the emissions.

Schaefer Kalk subsequently brought the matter before the Berlin Administrative Court and argued that Article 49(1) of Regulation No 601/2012 and point 10(B) of Annex IV thereto subject carbon dioxide bound in PCC and transferred for the production of that substance to mandatory participation in the EU ETS, and are therefore not covered by the powers granted under Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Berlin Administrative Court then referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).

The ECJ held that the second sentence of Article 49(1) of Regulation No 601/2012 and point 10(B) of Annex IV to that regulation are invalid in so far as they systematically include the carbon dioxide transferred to another installation for the production of PCC in the emissions of the lime combustion installation, regardless of whether or not that carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],"['European Union>Secondary Law>Regulations>Commission Regulation 601/2012', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC']",Company challenged treatment of carbon dioxide that becomes chemically bound as emitted for purposes of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/schaefer-kalk-gmbh-co-kg-v-germany/
Elektriciteits Produktiemaatschappij Zuid-Nederland EPZ NV v. Dutch Emissions Authority,"The European Court of Justice (EJC) held that a coal-fired power plant and unburned coal in a storage site constitute one installation covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).  The EJC further concluded that the coal lost due to self-heating while in storage could not be regarded as exported fuel for purposes of monitoring emissions. 

Elektriciteits Produktiemaatschappij Zuid-Nederland EPZ NV (EPZ) operates a coal-fired power plant in the Netherlands and holds a quantity of its unburned coal in a storage site approximately 800 meters from the power plant, which is separated from it by a public road. When designing the monitoring plan for the installation operated by EPZ for the third period of the EU ETS, the Dutch Emissions Authority (Nea) determined that coal lost due to its self-heating during the storage period could not be regarded as fuel exported from EPZs installation within the meaning of Article 27(2) of Regulation No 601/2012.

Consequently, the NEa refused to approve modifications of the monitoring plan sought by EPZ and later rejected EPZs objection to their initial decision. EPZ then lodged an appeal with the Dutch Raad van State (Council of State), seeking to have the latter decision annulled. The Council of State referred the case to the EJC and asked for a preliminary ruling on two questions.

(1) Could EPZs storage facility be considered an installation as referred to in Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC, which established the EU ETS? 

(2) Could EPZs lost coal due to its self-heating during storage be considered fuel exported from the installation as referred to in Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) No 601/2012?  That provision allows operators to deduct the quantity of fuel exported from the installation for purposes of monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. 

On the first question, the ECJ ruled that a fuel storage site of a coal-fired power plant is part of an installation within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ reasoned that the coals self-heating during storage does not amount to combustion and that it was not apparent that the coals self-heating required 20 MW of thermal input - two of the requirements for the storage site to be considered an installation under Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC. However, the ECJ ruled that the coal is essential to the functioning of the power plant and is therefore directly associated with the plants activity. Moreover, because the coals self-heating emits greenhouse gases, storing coal is an activity that could have an effect on emissions and pollution within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ deemed it irrelevant that the storage site is located approximately 800 meters and across a public road from the power plant.

On the second question, the ECJ ruled that coal lost due to self-heating while in storage on a site that is part of an installation cannot be regarded as coal exported from that installation. Because the storage site is part of an installation within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC, it cannot be regarded as a separate installation. Therefore, coal lost due to self-heating cannot be considered to be exported from the installation in question.",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],"['European Union>Secondary Law>Regulations>Commission Regulation 601/2012', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC']","Whether coal plant operator could count stored coal as a separate installation, and deduct coal lost during self-hearing while in storage, under the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

ArcelorMittal Rodange et Schifflange SA  v.  State of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,"Claimant challenged Luxembourg's law implementing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which permitted the government to request the surrender of emissions allowances, without compensation, that had not been used because the claimant had ceased greenhouse gas-emitting activities.  The European Court of Justice (ECJ) held that the Luxembourg law was not inconsistent with Directive 2003/87/EC, which established the EU ETS. 

ArcelorMittal Rodange et Schifflange SA (ArcelorMittal) operated an installation in Schifflange, Luxembourg until the end of 2011, which was subject to the EU ETS. Luxembourgs Minister of the Environment allocated ArcelorMittal a total quantity of 405,365 emissions allowances for the period between 2008 to 2012. In April 2012, ArcelorMittal requested that the Minister of the Environment cease environmental monitoring because the activities of its Schifflange installation had been suspended for an indefinite period since the end of 2011. In June 2013, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure (1) reduced the total emissions allowances allocated to ArcelorMittal between 2008 to 2012 and (2) requested that ArcelorMittal surrender 80,922 emissions allowances without compensation pursuant to Article 13(6) of a Luxembourgish law transposing Directive 2003/87/EC, the Law of 23 December 2004 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.  ArceclorMittal brought an action in an administrative court, which referred the matter to the Constitutional Court of Luxembourg, which in turn referred it to the EJC for a preliminary ruling. 

The question before the EJC was whether Article 13(6) of the 2004 law, which allows the Luxembourgish Minister of the Environment to order the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of allowances issued but not used, is compatible with Directive 2003/87/EC, or whether Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted as precluding national laws that allow the competent authorities to require the surrender without compensation of emissions allowances that have been issued but not used.

The ECJ held that Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation that allows member states to require the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of unused allowances that have been improperly issued to an operator, as a result of the operator's failure to comply with its obligation to timely inform the competent authority of the cessation of the operation of an installation. The EJC further concluded that the allowances issued after an operator has ceased the activities performed in the installation to which those allowances relate, without informing the competent authority beforehand, cannot be classified as emissions allowances within the meaning of Directive 2003/87.",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>EU ETS'],['European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2003/87/EC'],"Whether the EU emissions trading system permits member states to demand the surrender, without compensation, of unused allowances when a covered facility has ceased greenhouse gas-emitting activities.

Greenpeace Luxembourg v. Schneider,"In September 2019, Greenpeace Luxembourg brought an action in administrative court against the Luxembourgish Minister of Social Security, Roman Schneider.  Greenpeace claims that the Minister failed to respond to an August letter asking for information regarding how Luxembourg's sovereign pension fund planned to align its investments with the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and information on the climate-related financial risks associated with the fund's investments. 

According to Greenpeace, in December 2019 an administrative judge ruled that the claim was admissible because Minister Schneider failed to comply with his legal obligation to respond to the letter, and the information sought was covered by the Law on Access to Environmental Information.  However, the judge found no legal basis for requiring the Minister to comply with the Paris Agreement or to have the climate-related information that Greenpeace requested. Greenpeace reports that in March 2020, the president of the sovereign pension fund promised in a letter addressed to Greenpeace Luxembourg that the fund will deliver a sustainability report in the third quarter of 2020, including a detailed analysis of the carbon footprint and the climate-related financial risks of the fund's investments.

Grez et al. v. Environmental Evaluation Service of Chile,"Plaintiffs challenged the environmental impact assessment of a proposed coal blasting project for failure to consider climate impacts.  The environmental court of Valdivia blocked the project on other grounds. 

In November 2018 claimants brought suit to challenge the environmental impact assessment of the proposed project Incorporation of blasting as a complementary method in the mechanical extraction of sterile material in the Winter Mine.""  The Commission for Environmental Assessment of the Magallanes Region and the Chilean Antarctic had initially deemed the project's declaration of environmental impacts to be environmentally unfavorable.  When the mine operator challenged this conclusion, the Executive Director of the Commission of Environmental Assessment reversed the decision, determining that the project was environmentally favorable.  Claimants asked the court to reinstated the initial determination.  They argued that the final environmental impact statement failed to consider the climate impacts of coal blasting in violation of Chile's commitments under international law, including the Paris Agreement, as well as the preventive principle.  The plaintiffs further asserted the need to eliminate the use of fossil fuels, and in particular coal, on a global level in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 

In August 2019 the court issued a decision.  The court acknowledged that climate change is a global problem, but concluded that Chile's international commitments do not impose a legal requirement to consider climate change in environmental impact assessments.

La Rose v. Her Majesty the Queen,"On October 27, 2020, a Federal Court judge dismissed the lawsuit by Canadian youth against the Canadian government on a pretrial motion to strike for failing to state a reasonable cause of action. The plaintiffs appealed the case to the Federal Court of Appeal on November 24. 

Fifteen children and youths brought suit against the Queen and Attorney General of Canada in October 2019, alleging that Canada emits and contributes to emitting greenhouse gases that are incompatible with a stable climate. The plaintiffs argue that Canada's actions have violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, as well as the rights of present and future Canadian children under the public trust doctrine. They seek declaratory relief and an order requiring the government to adopt a Climate Recovery Plan. 

In dismissing the case, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs' claims that Canada's conduct violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms are not justiciable and state no reasonable cause of action. According to the judge, the claims are not justiciable because they allege ""an overly broad and unquantifiable number of actions and inactions on the part of the Defendants."" Similarly, these claims do not state a reasonable cause of action because they point to broad and diffused conduct by the government and do not identify a particular law that burdens youth. 

The judge found that the plaintiffs' claims that the government's conduct violated the public trust doctrine was justiciable, but similarly found that it stated no reasonable cause of action because the claim was extensive, had no definable limits, and was not consistent with incremental evolutions in the law. 

Plaintiffs are children and youth in Canada who allege that they have been and will continue to be exposed to climate change impacts that interfere with their physical and psychological well being, as well as their ability to make fundamental life choices. The plaintiffs assert that because of their vulnerability and age, they will bear a disproportionate share of the burden imposed by climate change. They claim that Canada has caused, contributed to, and allowed a level of greenhouse gas emissions that is incompatible with a stable climate system; adopted greenhouse gas emissions targets that are inconsistent with the best available science regarding what action is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change; failed to meet its own national greenhouse gas emission targets; and actively participated in and supported the development, expansion, and operation of industries and activities involving fossil fuels that emit a level of greenhouse gases that is incompatible with a stable climate.  

Plaintiffs seek declarations that defendants have unjustifiably infringed their rights -- and the rights of all present and future children and youth in Canada -- under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated Section 7 of the Charter, which protects the rights to life, liberty and security; and Section 15 of the Charter, which provides that every individual is equal under the law. Plaintiffs also argue that Canada has a common law and constitutional obligation to protect the integrity of common natural resources that are fundamental to sustaining human life and liberties, and seek a declaration that defendants have failed to discharge their public trust obligations with respect to those resources. Finally, they seek an order requiring defendants to develop and implement an enforceable Climate Recovery Plan that is consistent with Canada's fair share of the global carbon budget necessary to achieve greenhouse gas emissions, and ask the court to retain jurisdiction to ensure the plan is implemented.  

On February 7, 2020 the government filed a statement of defense acknowledging that climate change is real and has a significant effect on Canada, but arguing that the plaintiffs lack public interest standing and that their claims are not justiciable. Plaintiffs responded on August 31. On October 27, in spite of acknowledging that the negative impact of climate change to the Plaintiffs and all Canadians is significant, both now and looking forward into the future, Justice Michael D. Manson of the Federal Court of Canada granted the governments motion to strike the plaintiffs claim. Attorneys for the youth plaintiffs intend to appeal. On November 24, the plaintiffs filed their Notice of Appeal with the Federal Court of Appeals, alleging Justice Manson erred in striking the plaintiffs claims.

Friends of the Earth et al. v. Total,"Six nongovernmental organizations have sued energy company Total over an oil project in Uganda and Tanzania. The plaintiffs allege that Total failed to adequately assess the project's threats to human rights and the environment. 

Under 2017 French Duty of Vigilance Law, French companies must identify and prevent, in a due diligence plan (plan de vigilance), serious violations of human rights and to the environment that could occur as a result of their business practices, including at the level of their foreign subsidiaries and subcontractors. In June 2019, Friends of the Earth France, Survie, AFIEGO, CRED, NAPE/Friends of the Earth Uganda and NAVODA sent Total a formal demand to revise its vigilance plan for the Tilenga Project, along with a report detailing alleged inadequacies in the vigilance plan. These associations claimed that Total did not take into account the social and environmental impacts of the oil project located on the shores of Lake Albert, in western Uganda, and the 1,445 km pipeline that will export fossil fuel by crossing part of the country and then Tanzania to reach the port of Tanga, on the Indian Ocean. Some 100,000 people are to be displaced and a third of the 400 boreholes are to be drilled in the Murchinson Falls National Park, which is home to a significant number of endangered species. The claimants sought an order to take urgent action to prevent the manifestly unlawful disturbance resulting the companys failure to comply with its due diligence obligations. In the alternative, the claimants sought an order, subject to fine, to establish, publish and implement a set of measures in its due diligence plan to prevent (i) serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health and safety and (ii) serious environmental damage. Although the claimants' report focuses on human rights and conventional pollution, it also argues that Total's vigilance plan does not properly account for the project's potential life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. 

Total rejected the allegations and argued that the court in which the case was filed was not competent. On January 30, 2020, the Nanterre Judicial Court ruled that it was not competent to hear the case and that it must be brought before a commercial court. On December 10th, 2020, the Court of Appeal of Versailles decided that the case should be brought before the Nanterre Commercial Court because the due diligence plan should be qualified as an act of management of a commercial company. 

On December 15th, 2021, the Court of Cassation overturned the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal and recognized the competence of the judicial court to judge the complaint of the associations. The case will be decided by the Nanterre Judicial Court, and not by the Commercial Court as Total had claimed. The Court of Cassation recalled that (i) companies duty of vigilance does not constitute a commercial act and (ii) a natural person plaintiff can bring a claim against a legal entity before the judicial court or the commercial court. While this decision is favorable for the claimant, more than 100 000 people are still totally or partially deprived of their land and their means of subsistence in Uganda and Tanzania, according to Friends of the Earth France.

R (on the application of McLennan) v. Medway Council,"A British court ruled that a local planning board had erred in granting a development permit without considering whether the proposed project would affect the neighbor's ability to generate electricity from his solar panels. 

In October 2017, the claimant received permission to install solar panels on the south-facing wall of his residential property in Rochester, Kent. In September 2018, the claimant's next-door neighbor, whose detached residence lies immediately to the south of the claimant's house, applied to the Medway Council for planning permission for the construction of a dormer.  The claimant objected on the ground that the proposed development would block the sun, and adversely affect his ability to generate electricity from his solar panels. The planning board granted permission in December 2018.   

After the claimant challenged the permit, the Court concluded that the planning board incorrectly decided that the claimant's concerns about the development's effect on his solar system were immaterial.  The Court reasoned that both the Medway Local Plan and the British National Planning Policy Framework recognize the positive contribution of even small-scale renewable energy schemes to addressing climate change. The Court further held that the planning board erred in deciding that the claimant's objection was purely a matter of private interest -- as opposed to public interest -- given the role of solar energy in reducing greenhouse gases. The Court accordingly quashed the permit.

"Mathur, et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Ontario","Seven youth brought suit alleging that Ontario violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom (""the Charter"") by abdicating its responsibility to address climate change. 

Plaintiffs argue that Ontario has failed to meet the challenge of avoiding catastrophic climate change, which must be done within eleven years according to the scientific community.  They further claim that Canada is not on track to meet the goals laid out in the Paris Agreement, in large part due to Ontario's 2030 greenhouse gas reduction target of 30% below 2005 levels, set under the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018. In plaintiffs' view, this target -- which is less ambitious than previously adopted targets -- is inadequate. Plaintiffs assert a genuine interest in preventing catastrophic climate change that poses pervasive and serious risks to the health and wellbeing of their generation and future generations of Ontarians. Their claims arise under sections 7 and 15 of the Charter, which provide the right to life, liberty and security of the person; and equal protection under the law, respectively.

Plaintiffs seek, among other things, a declaration that Ontario's target violates the rights of Ontario youth and future generations under sections 7 and 15 of the Charter; a declaration that Ontario's target violates an unwritten constitutional principle that governments may not engage in conduct that will, or unreasonably could be expected to, result in the future harm, suffering or death of a significant number of its own citizens; a declaration that section 7 of the Charter includes the right to a stable climate system, capable of providing youth and future generations with a sustainable future; a declaration that sections 3(1) and/or 16 of the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, which repealed the Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016, and allowed for the imposition of more lenient targets without mandating that they be set according to the Paris Agreement's goals or any sort of science-based process, violates sections 7 and 15 of the Charter; an order that Ontario set a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target that is consistent with Ontario's share of the minimum level of greenhouse gas reductions necessary to limit global warming to below 1.5 degrees Celsius or well below 2 degrees Celsius; and an order directing Ontario to revise is climate change plan once it has set such a target. 

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on April 15, arguing that the Charter does not guarantee a right to a stable climate, the plaintiffs lack standing to represent future generations, the plaintiffs have shown no reasonable cause of action, and the plaintiffs cannot prove their allegations. 

On November 12, 2020, the Superior Court Justice rejected the motion to dismiss on the grounds that it not plain and obvious that the plaintiffs present no reasonable cause of action. The justice reasoned that both the GHG reduction target and the repeal of the Climate Change Act are reviewable by the court for their compliance with the Charter. According to the plaintiffs, this is the first time a Canadian court has ruled that climate change may threaten fundamental rights under the Charter.

Complaint against BP in respect of violations of the OECD Guidelines,"The British environmental group ClientEarth has filed a complaint against British Petroleum (BP), alleging that the energy company's current advertising misleads the public. 

ClientEarth asserts that an advertising campaign launched in January 2019 under the titles ""Keep Advancing"" and ""Possibilities Everywhere"" is misleading in the way it presents BP's low-carbon energy activities.  The complaint alleges that the campaign runs afoul of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which require clear, honest, accurate and informative communications between enterprises and the public. The complaint asserts that the advertising gives a false impression of the relative scale of renewable and low-carbon energy in BP's business; misleadingly omits full lifecycle emissions for natural gas and claims an inaccurate emissions saving against coal combustion; and misleadingly asserts that increases in global primary energy demand are both desirable and inevitable for human progress and development. 

ClientEarth filed the complaint against BP with the UK National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (UK NCP), an administrative body. The complaint asks BP to take certain steps to correct the allegedly misleading information, including by withdrawing specific advertisements and issuing a statement explaining the withdrawal. The complaint further asks that the UK NCP find BP in violation of the OECD Guidelines if BP does not take the requested steps. 

As a result of the complaint, BP has withdrawn the advertising campaign and pledged that it will discontinue corporate reputation
advertising and redirect resources to promote net zero policies, ideas, actions, collaborations and its own net zero ambition. Although the NCP's Initial Assessment confirmed that the complaint was material and substantiated, the case was subsequently discontinued after BP withdrew the advertising campaign in question.

"Repsol Sinopec Resources UK Ltd v. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy","An appellate regulatory body dismissed a claim that in seeking to recover over-allocated allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a UK regulator needed to ""net off"" other allowances to which the operator was entitled. 

Appellant Repsol holds a greenhouse gas emissions permit under the EU ETS for an offshore oil-production, storage and offloading unit called Bleo Holm. Pursuant to the EU ETS, Repsol received a free allocation of allowances for the period 2012-2017 based on a historic baseline assessment of CO2 emissions from Bleo Holm, and was required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover its total emissions each year, whether the free allowances or additional allowances that had been purchased.  Following an investigation, the Offshore Production Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) found that there had been a significant decrease in capacity at Bleo Holm and, as a result, determined that Repsol was not entitled to all of the free allowances that it had received.  OPRED sought to recover the over-allocated allowances under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).  OPRED is still investigating another significant capacity reduction issue which may have resulted in an over-allocation of allowances to Repsol. 

While the issues related to Repsol's allowances for 2013-2017 were under review, in December 2018, the European Commission decided to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators in light of the uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union.  As a result, Repsol did not receive free allowances in 2018 as expected, and so the company had to purchase sufficient allowances to offset its emissions for that year. 

In March 2019 Repsol appealed BEIS's Notice of Recovery, bringing three claims before the Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber. First, Repsol contended that BEIS should not have sought to recover the total number of allowances that had been over-allocated for 2012-2017, but rather, should have netted off the allowances that Repsol did not receive in 2018 due to the European Commission's decision to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators.  Second, Repsol argued that the European Commission's decision to withhold allowances from UK operators was unlawful.  Third, Repsol claimed that by seeking recovery of allowances without netting off the allowances to which Repsol was entitled, BEIS violated Repsol's property rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Repsol asked the Tribunal to quash the Notice of Recovery.

On November 18, 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. According to the Tribunal's order, the parties agree there was an over-allocation of allowances as a result of Repsol's failure to notify BEIS of the decreased capacity at Bleo Holm, and so BEIS had the power to issue a Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further explained that although a Notice of Recovery must provide certain information to an operator, this does not include the details of any calculation to determine the sum of allowances to which the operator is entitled.  Therefore, the Tribunal reasoned, the sum of allowances does not include any netting-off calculation. Moreover, the 2012 regulations are intended to implement a strict accounting system.  Given this, the Tribunal determined that BEIS did not err in declining to net off any allowances from the Notice of Recovery.  The Tribunal further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to re-interpret the European Commission's decision to suspend allowance allocations to UK operators or to declare the decision unlawful.  Finally, the Tribunal held that it lacked the power to resolve Repsol's property rights claim.

"Preston New Road Action Group v. Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, Lancashire County Council, Cuadrilla Bowland Ltd., Cuadrilla Elswick Ltd.","The UK Court of Appeal upheld the government's decision to permit natural gas exploration at two sites, rejecting claims that the government failed require sufficient cumulative impact analysis and should have considered the possible climate effects of any future natural gas production. 

In 2016 the UK Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government issued a decision allowing exploratory wells and associated monitoring to test the feasibility of the commercial extraction of shale gas at two sites in Lancashire.  The decision was challenged in an action that the Administrative Court dismissed.  In 2017, the Preston New Road Action Group and an individual named Gayzer Frackman both appealed the dismissal on different grounds; Frackman's appeal raised several climate-related issues. 

Frackman claimed, among other things, that the Secretary of State failed to follow Directive 2011/92/EU, which requires that an environmental impact assessment analyze indirect, secondary, and cumulative effects. Frackman argued that the Secretary had improperly failed to require an assessment of the effects of greenhouse gas emissions arising from the extended flow testing phase of the proposed project. The court disagreed, concluding that greenhouse gas emissions associated with exploration were fully assessed. Frackman also challenged the omission of any analysis of the indirect impacts of the succeeding production stage if the exploration proved the existence of a viable shale gas play. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that any possible future proposal would have to be considered on its own panning merits in light of a new environmental assessment. Finally, Frackman asserted that the Secretary was inconsistent in considering the potential benefits of natural gas in meeting the UK's planning goal of transitioning to a low-carbon future without assessing potential harms. The court dismissed this argument, concluding that the Secretary properly determined that shale gas exploration would help to achieve the objective of reducing carbon by establishing whether commercially viable natural gas existed on the sites in question.

The court dismissed both appeals in their entirety.

Specific instance under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises submitted to the Slovenian and UK National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines,"A coalition of social and environmental groups filed a complaint alleging that a British company violated the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises in applying for a permit to expand a fracking operation in Slovenia. 

The complaint was filed with the Slovenian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines (NCP) by Focus Association for Sustainable Development and 16 other nongovernmental organizations and civil initiatives. The complainants assert that the UK-based company Ascent Resources plc (""Ascent Resources"") violated the OECD Guidelines in applying for a permit to expand a fracking operation at a natural gas field near Petisovci, Slovenia.  The complaint also implicates Ascent Resources's subsidiary in Slovenia, Ascent Resources d.o.o., and its contractor, Geonergo, d.o.o. 

The complaint asserts that Ascent Resources ran afoul of the OECD Guidelines by: failing to take adequate steps to consider and address the potential environmental impacts of fracking, including fracking's contribution to the threat of runaway climate change; failing to work with a view to achieving sustainable development and take due account of the need to protect the environment; engaging in improper political involvement by organizing a lobby campaign to pressure the Slovenian Ministry of the Environment to complete the permitting process for the fracking expansion without complication; failing to undertake required due diligence by not ensuring that its subsidiary and contractor considered all the environmental and health risks of fracking; incentivizing its subsidiary and contractor to cause adverse environmental and health impacts through fracking; and improperly avoided engagement with relevant stakeholders including local anti-fracking groups. The complaint also faults Geonergo, Ascent Resources's contractor, for seeking an exemption from the need to undertake an environmental impact assessment.  The complainants argue that the NCP should view Ascent Resources's activities in the context of international climate treaties given that fracking contributes to global climate change. 

The complainants request that the Slovenian NCP bring their concerns to Ascent Resources and facilitate a dialogue aimed at ending the company's fracking activities in Slovenia. They also call on the UK NCP to support the Slovenian NCP in handling the complaint. Should a mediated solution prove unattainable, the complainants ask that the NCP inform the Slovenian authorities of the alleged breaches of the OECD Guidelines and urge that the allegations be considered in the permitting process.

Yokosuka Climate Case,"Complaint:
On May 27, 2019, 45 Japanese citizens filed suit to block the construction of a new coal-fired power plant. The plaintiffs filed a legal challenge against the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, seeking cancelation of the notice of finalization of the environmental impact assessment for the construction of two new coal-fired generating units - totaling 1,300 MW - at the Yokosuka power plant. The plaintiffs allege that JERA, the plant operator, improperly exploited a streamlined assessment process for replacements or upgrades that the Japanese Government created after the Fukushima Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.

Update:
On 27th January 2023, Tokyo District Court delivered a judgment that dealt with the request to cancel the Notice of Confirmation issued by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry who confirmed the Environmental Impact Assessment of JERA under Article 46 (17) (ii) of the Electricity Business Act.

Firstly, the judgment discussed if the Notice of Confirmation was considered disposition against which an administrative complaint could be made. On this point, the Court determined that the Notice of Confirmation was considered disposition within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the Administrative Case Litigation Act since the recipient of the Notice was an essential requirement for starting the operation of a power plant and granted legal status to JERA.

Secondly, the judgment discussed if the Plaintiffs had standing and to what extent claims could be made. The Court stated that those persons who lived close to the coal-fired power plant and were likely to directly suffer significant damage from air pollution had legal interests to request the cancelation of the Notice of Confirmation. On the other hand, the Court stated that the damage from climate change could not be considered an individual interest to be protected by law. Thus, the Court recognized the standing of the Plaintiffs who lived within 20 km from the coal-fired power plant related to air pollution but did not recognize the standing and claims related to climate change and CO2 emissions. 

Lastly, the judgment discussed if the Notice of Confirmation was legal. The Court stated that the consideration of the alternative fuels was not obligatory and the use of the simplified procedure of the assessment was rational when the nature of the power plant (in this case, replacement) fell under the scope the rationalized guidelines. Therefore, the use of the simplified procedure in accordance with the rationalized guidelines was not against the Power Plant Assessment Ordinance and there were no procedural defects in the assessment of the impact of air pollution. Moreover, the Court stated that there were no reasons to predict that the level of the environmental impact would increase by the construction. The Court concluded that the Notice of Confirmation was legal as its content was adequate and there was no deviation nor abuse of power by the Minister.

On the same day, the Citizens Committee released a statement saying that the judgment was unjust for the Court rejected the standing of the Plaintiffs in relation to climate change and determined that that the evaluation of PM 2.5 and consideration of the use of alternative fuels were not necessary.

Alvarez et al v. Peru,"On December 16, 2019, a group of Peruvian youth filed suit against Peru, alleging that the government has taken insufficient action to address climate change. 

Seven plaintiffs, represented by their parents, filed a complaint against the Peruvian state for its alleged failure to adequately halt deforestation in the Amazon rainforest by adopting concrete and effective measures under the National Policy on the Environment and the National Policy on Forests and Forest Wildlife. The complaint focuses on deforestation in five Amazonian regions: Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, Amazonas and San Martin. The plaintiffs argue that the situation is worse for Peruvians born between 2005 and 2011, whose futures are severely compromised due to the climate crisis. They assert that their fundamental right to enjoy a healthy environment has been violated, along with their rights to life, water, and health. 

The plaintiffs' claims arise under article 2.22 of the Peruvian constitution; article 12.2 of the International Pact of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; article 11 of the Additional Protocol of the American Convention on Human Rights; article 3 of the Code of Children and Adolescents; article I of Law no. 28611, General Law of the Environment; and article 15 of the Interamerican Democratic Charter.

Credit Suisse Protesters Trials,"On January 13, 2020 a Swiss court ruled in favor of a dozen climate activists who occupied a Credit Suisse branch to protest the bank's fossil fuel investments. The judge concluded that because of the imminent danger of the climate crisis, the protesters' actions were necessary and proportional. 

In November 2018, twelve climate activists wearing white sports clothes and wigs staged a tennis match at a Lausanne branch of Credit Suisse to protest the bank's fossil fuel investments and pressure tennis star Roger Federer to end his sponsorship arrangement with the institution. According to news reports, the protesters were charged with trespassing and fined 21,600 Swiss Francs ($22,000). On appeal, Judge Philippe Colelough concluded that the activists had acted proportionately to the imminence of climate danger and waived the fine. He wrote, ""Because of the insufficient measures taken to date in Switzerland, whether they be economic or political, the average warming will not diminish nor even stabilize, it will increase,"" the judge explained. ""In view of this, the tribunal considers that the imminence of danger is established. . . . The act for which they were incriminated was a necessary and proportional means to achieve the goal they sought.""

The acquittal was overturned by the Swiss Court of Appeals in Renens on September 22, 2020. The Court convicted the defendants and ordered them to pay fines of up to 150 francs ($160). The Court reasoned that although the danger from climate change is imminent, the protesters could have used other means to protest the bank. 

In a parallel case in Geneva, protesters were convicted in the trial court, and the conviction was overturned on appeal to the Court of Appeals in Geneva. 

According to a lawyer in the Lausanne case, both cases have been appealed to the Swiss Federal Court and are awaiting a reply.

UN Human Rights Committee Views Adopted on Teitiota Communication,"A citizen of Kiribati filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee claiming that New Zealand had violated his right to life by denying him asylum despite his assertions that climate change made Kiribati uninhabitable. The Committee concluded that the communication was admissible, but that New Zealand's decision was not clearly arbitrary, a manifest error, or a denial of justice. 

In 2013, Ioene Teitiota, a Kiribati citizen, sought asylum in New Zeleand, asserting that the effects of climate change and sea level rise forced him to migrate. When the Immigration and Protection Tribunal denied his claim, he appealed to the New Zealand High Court. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify Teitiota for refugee status because he was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Teitioa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. Teitiota again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts conclusions, but did not rule out the possibility that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could [] create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.

On September 15, 2015, Teitiota filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee, alleging that New Zealand had violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights. He argued that sea level rise in Kiribati caused by climate change has created a scarcity of habitable space, resulting in violent land disputes, and environmental degradation including saltwater contamination of the freshwater supply.  On January 7, 2020, the Committee ruled that the communication was admissible because Teitiota had sufficiently substantiated his claim that when he was removed to Kiribati he faced an imminent risk of being arbitrarily deprived of his life due to the effects of sea level rise. The Committee reasoned that the requirement of imminence attaches to the decision to remove the individual, and not to the anticipated harm in the receiving state, although the latter is relevant in assessing the real risk faced by the individual. 

The Committee dismissed the communication on the merits, however, explaining that it could only reverse a States party's determination that was clearly arbitrary or amounted to a manifest error or a denial of justice. The Committee reasoned that the risk of an arbitrary deprivation of life must be personal, rather than rooted in the general conditions of the receiving state, except in the most extreme cases. The Committee recognized that environmental degradation and climate change constitute serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life, but upheld New Zealand's determination that Teitiota had not provided evidence that he faced any real chance of being harmed in a land dispute, would be unable to grow food or access potable water, or otherwise faced life-threatening conditions.

The Committee did find, however, that ""given that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water is such an extreme risk, the conditions of life in such a country may become incompatible with the right to life with dignity before the risk is realized."" Accepting Teitiota's claim that sea level rise is likely to render Kiribati uninhabitable, the Committee explained that given the 10-15 year timeframe, there was sufficient time for intervening acts by the government of Kiribati to protect its citizens. 

Two Committee members dissented. One attacked the majority's reliance on the lack of evidence that Teitiota's family lacked potable water, explaining that ""potable"" does not equate to ""safe drinking water."" The second argued that the Committee placed an unreasonable burden of proof on Teitiota to establish a real risk of danger of arbitrary deprivation of life.

"Citizens' Committee on the Kobe Coal-Fired Power Plant v. Kobe Steel Ltd., et al.","On September 14, 2018, thirty-one families filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent the construction and operation of two units at a coal-fired plant in Kobe, Japan. The plaintiffs are represented by the Citizens' Committee on the Kobe Coal-Fired Power Plant and named Kobe Steel Ltd., Kobelco Power Kobe No. 2 Inc. and Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. as defendants.  According to the plaintiffs, the new units would have a total output of 1,300 megawatts, and emit 0.6% of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions from energy. They assert that the construction and operation of the new coal-fired units would violate the right to clean air and a healthy and clean environment and right to enjoy a stable climate; conflict with Japan's 2030 and 2050 climate targets; and pollute in residential areas where air quality standards are already being violated.  

On March 20, 2023, the Kobe District Court delivered a judgment discussing the request for an injunction to the construction and operation of the coal-fired power plants. 

Firstly, the Kobe District Court discussed if air pollution caused by the coal-fired power plants would violate personal rights of the citizens. As for those Plaintiffs who live far from Kobe city, the Court said that there was no threat of a violation of personal rights to life, bodily integrity, and health by the emission of air pollutants from the power plants in question.  As for the other Plaintiffs, the Court examined if there was a concrete danger to determine a violation of personal rights. To determine this, the Court considered the Notice of Finalization that affirmed the assessment of SO2, NO2, SPM, and mercury and concluded that those substances would not create a concrete danger to the citizens. Further, regarding PM2.5 which was not included in the assessment, the Court considered the outcome of the simulation but did not recognize the existence of a concrete danger either. Consequently, the Court did not find a violation of personal rights to life, bodily integrity, and health. 

Secondly, the Kobe District Court determined if air pollution caused by the coal-fired power plants would violate the right to a peaceful life. The Court repeated that there was no concrete danger to life or health and stated that granting an injunction based on non-serious anxiety about a healthy life could not limit socio-economic activities. Hence, the Court concluded that there was no violation of the right to a peaceful life.

Thirdly, the Court discussed if climate change aggravated by the use of the coal-fired power plants would violate personal rights. On this point, the Court states that climate change is likely to occur in Hyogo as the progression of global warming would affect the entire earth and the Plaintiffs may suffer damage, yet the Court continues by saying that there are many uncertain factors including the level of damage by disasters and the place where a disaster actually happens. Moreover, the Plaintiffs argued that the existence of a concrete danger should be judged by the level of danger of climate change by considering the carbon emission reduction targets by the international community. The Court stated that the concrete danger could not be equated with the danger of global warming as a whole since the concrete danger of damage to the Plaintiffs needed to be determined on the basis of damage that global warming would cause to each individual whereas the reduction targets aimed at preventing global warming for the whole earth. 
Further, the Court stated that the operation of the coal-fired power plants would not immediately render the achievement of the reduction targets impossible. Thus, the Court did not recognize the existence of a concrete danger to the Plaintiffs life, bodily integrity, and health while it stated that there could be an abstract danger by the emission of CO2 that could aggravate global warming.

Lastly, the Court discussed if climate change would violate the right to a peaceful life, or the right to a stable climate which the Plaintiffs claimed as being included in the right to a peaceful life. First, the Court stated that the Plaintiffs anxiety about climate change was not serious as it was about the uncertain danger in the future. Second, the Court said that the Plaintiffs claim was considered as a request to protect the environment in the absence of a concrete danger and that the right to a stable climate was not legally protected. Third, the Court stated that even if those points made above were affirmative the responsibility could not be unilaterally attributed to the new coal-fired power plants in question.

In conclusion, the Kobe District Court did not find a ground for an injunction. On April 1, 2023, the citizens appealed the judgment.",Pending,['Japan>Kobe District Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']",['Japan>Human Rights'],Families sought to prevent construction of new coal-fired units.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/citizens-committee-on-the-kobe-coal-fired-power-plant-v-kobe-steel-ltd-et-al/
Citizens Committee on the Kobe Coal-Fired Power Plant v. Japan,"On November 19, 2018, twelve residents of the Japanese city of Kobe filed an administrative action against the government seeking more ambitious action on climate change. The plaintiffs asked the Osaka District Court to compel the government to cancel the notice of finalization of an environmental assessment of two new coal-fired units, which the plaintiffs allege would emit about 7 million tons of carbon dioxide per year. The plaintiffs also seek an order finding that the government has unlawfully failed to establish regulatory standards consistent with the Paris Agreement. 

On March 15, 2021, the Osaka District Court rejected the plaintiffs request to cancel the Notice of Finalization issued by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, concerning the construction plan of the new coal-fired Units based on two reasons. Firstly, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing since there was a general rather individual public interest in the potential health damages caused by global warming. Secondly, the Court determined that the Notice of Finalization was not illegal as the decision of the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry was neither deviation nor abuse of discretionary power.

On March 26, 2021, the citizens filed an appeal. In the Statement of Appeal, the Plaintiffs argued that the emission of GHG can be a violation of human rights of individuals as climate change damages a persons life, body, and property. Moreover, they claim that the denial of standing is a violation of their right of access to the courts. Further, they demand the court to revisit the appropriateness of the environmental impact assessment and the Notice of Finalization. 

On April 26, 2022, the Osaka High Court upheld the judgment by the Osaka District Court rejecting the request of the appellants to revoke the Notice of Finalization. In this judgment, the Osaka High Court discussed whether the appellants had standing under administrative law and whether the Notice of Finalization was illegal. Regarding the first point of the dispute, the court stated that there must a legally protected individual interest to have standing under administrative law. While the court recognized the standing of the appellants in relation to air pollution, the court ruled that the interest of the appellants do not include climate damage and that CO2 emissions are not recognized as a legally protected interest in the current society. The court further states that this interest should be pursued in the policy-making process as a general public interest. However, the court does not deny the possibility of a future change in this interpretation. If there is a change in the social situation or understanding, the interest to not incur damage through climate change and the CO2 emissions may be recognized as a legally protected individual interest.

Regarding the second point, the legality of the Notice of Finalization, the court was not able to determine its legality based on the CO2 emissions as this was a policy issue. Moreover, concerning the lack of consideration of PM 2.5 emissions and concerns related to the emissions of other pollutants, the court stated that there was no deviation nor abuse of the discretionary power. Thus, the Notice of Finalization was legal. The citizens expressed their intent to further bring the case to the Supreme Court.

On May 6, 2022, the citizens filed a final appeal and asked the supreme court to reverse the judgment given on April 26, 2022.

On March 9, 2023, the Supreme Court rejected the request for a final appeal and the judgment by the Osaka High Court was upheld. The Supreme Court stated that it did not find grounds for a final appeal under Article 312 of the Code of Civil Procedure but no specific reasons were given.",decided,"['Japan>Osaka High Court', 'Japan>Osaka District Court']","['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects']","['Japan>Electricity Business Act', 'Japan>Environmental Impact Assessment Act', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Japan>Human Rights', 'Japan>Administrative Law']","Whether the Notice of Finalization by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry allowing the construction and subsequent operation of new coal-fired power plants is legal based on the greenhouse gas emissions.

Rights of Indigenous People in Addressing Climate-Forced Displacement,"Five U.S. Indian tribes submitted a complaint to the United Nations alleging that the U.S. government has violated their human rights in failing to address climate displacement. The complaint calls on several Special Rapporteurs to intervene and investigate, and to recommend that the U.S. government and the states of Alaska and Louisiana take steps to address displacement caused by climate change. 

The Alaska Institute for Justice submitted the complaint on behalf of five tribes located in Louisiana and Alaska: Point-au-Chien Indian Tribe, Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Citimacha-Cochtow Tribe, the Atakapa-Ishak Chawasha Tribe of the Grand Bayou Indian Village, and the Native Village of Kivalina. The complaint is directed to the Special Rapporteurs on the Human Rights of Internally Displaced Persons, and the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, among others.  The complainants assert that they are being forcibly displaced from their ancestral lands as a result of climate change, and that the U.S. government has failed to protect them despite knowing for decades that climate change threatens coastal communities. They further contend that the U.S. government's inaction has gone beyond basic negligence where the government has failed to engage, consult, acknowledge and promote the self-determination of the tribes as they develop adaptation strategies, including resettlement. The complaint also alleges that by failing to federally recognize the named Louisiana tribes, the U.S. government is further hamstringing efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change.

The complaint asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the U.S. government recognize the self-determination and inherent sovereignty of all the tribes; grant federal recognition to those that have not yet received it; and take certain steps to protect the tribes' land and cultural heritage, among other things.  The complaint further asks the Special Rapporteurs to recommend that the Louisiana state government allocate funding to the named Louisiana tribes to respond to the humanitarian crisis caused by climate change; require the oil and gas industry to give advanced notice of their intent to conduct operations that may pose a risk to tribal cultural heritage, land, and waters; and hold oil and gas corporations responsible for damages caused to the Louisiana coast, among other things. The complaint also seeks a recommendation that the Alaska state government allocate funding to implement the tribal-led relocation process for Kivalina, and that all three governments develop relocation institutional frameworks.

The complainants' claims arise out of the Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, the Pinheiro Principles on Housing and Property Restitution, and the Peninsula Principles on human rights that must be enforced when people are forcibly displaced because of climate change. The complaint also cites the right to self-determination of all peoples, the Charter of the UN, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action, and Article 3 of the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. 

In September 2020, the Special Rapporteurs communicated the case the U.S. government, detailed the allegations, sought clarification on the measures taken by the government, and included a reference annex on international human rights law.

Ruling on Modification to Ethanol Fuel Rule,"On January 22, 2020, the Supreme Court of Mexico invalidated an agency action that would have allowed higher ethanol content in gasoline. The Court concluded that the precautionary principle and the right to a healthy environment require consideration of ethanol's environmental risks, including its contributions to greenhouse gas emissions. 

In 2017 Mexico's Energy Regulatory Commission modified a fuel rule to allow a maximum of 10% ethanol in gasoline sales, up from 5.8%. The modified rule would have applied nationwide, with exceptions for Mexico's three largest cities, where air pollution is of particular concern. The Supreme Court invalidated the measure, citing the potential for higher levels of pollution with a greater maximum ethanol content, including the potential for increased greenhouse gas emissions. The Court recognized that the measure could lower the cost of fuel, but determined that economic considerations must be balanced against the right to a healthy environment and Mexico's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as a signatory of the Paris Agreement. The Court concluded that a measure carrying significant environmental risks must be evaluated using the best scientific information available and should not be enacted without public participation. In reaching this conclusion, the Court cited the right to consultation in environmental matters as well as the precautionary principle.",Decided,['Mexico>Supreme Court'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights'],['Mexico>Constitution'],Whether Mexico's rule increasing the maximum ethanol fuel content is constitutional. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ruling-on-modification-to-ethanol-fuel-rule/
ClientEarth v. Secretary of State,"On January 30, 2020, the environmental group ClientEarth filed an action in the High Court challenging the UK government's decision to approve a natural gas plant, which would be Europe's largest. 

The Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy approved the plant in October, despite the Planning Authority's recommendation that the plant be blocked due to climate change considerations. According to a press release issued by a barristers union, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the Secretary misinterpreted the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy in assessing the project's greenhouse gas emissions; failed to properly assess the carbon-capture readiness of the facility; and did not consider the UK's mandate to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in a procedurally fair manner or, alternatively, failed to give adequate reasons for her assessment of the net zero target. The High Court gave ClientEarth permission to sue the government. 

The High Court ruled for the defendants on May 22, 2020. The judge determined that the case involved policy questions requiring a balancing of interests, and that other public interests weigh against the UK's climate goals and for the plant's approval. These include the plant's contribution to security and diversity of energy supply. On July 21, 2020 the Court of Appeal granted ClientEarth leave to appeal the case.

On January 21, 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and rejected ClientEarth's appeal, finding that the government's approval of the plant was lawful. The Court of Appeal found that the Secretary of State balanced the adverse effects of the project, including greenhouse gas emissions, with the positive effects, including socioeconomic outcomes and re-use of existing infrastructure, and lawfully concluded that the benefits outweighed the adverse impacts. The Court of Appeal departed from the High Court in reasoning that greenhouse gas emissions are capable of being treated as ""a freestanding reason for refusal"" by the Secretary. Nevertheless, the Court reasoned that such emissions are not an ""automatic and insuperable obstacle"" to approval of infrastructure projects, and the decision-maker has discretion over the weight to assign to greenhouse gas emissions in approval decisions.

Lho'imggin et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen,"Two houses of the Wetsuweten indigenous group filed a legal challenge on February 10, 2020 alleging that the Canadian government's approach to climate change has violated their constitutional and human rights. 

According to the complaint, plaintiffs Misdi Yikh and Sa Yikh are each a House group under Wetsuweten indigenous law, and comprise the Fireweed Clan. The plaintiff Lhoimggin is the dinize, or Head Chief, of Misdzi Yikh and the plaintiff Smogilhgim is the dini ze of Sa Yikh; each speaks for his House. 

The plaintiff complaint allege that Canada failed to meet its international commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, including those made at the 1988 International Conference on the Changing Atmosphere and under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1998 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the 2010 Cancun Agreement and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs further claim that Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement -- to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 -- is insufficient to meet its commitments to hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to keep warming to 1.5 degrees. Moreover, according to plaintiffs, Canada appears unlikely to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution.  Finally, plaintiffs argue that Canada has failed to use discretionary decision-making power under its environmental assessment legislation to withhold approval of greenhouse gas emitting projects -- in particular liquefied natural gas exports facilities -- to help bring Canada's trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement targets.

Plaintiffs contend that they have experienced significant warming effects on their territories and expect to experience negative health impacts due to climate change. They further assert that Canada's historical treatment of indigenous leaders and ongoing racial discrimination exacerbate the psychological and social trauma caused by climate change. Their claims arise principally under Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (duty to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada); Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (right to life, liberty and security of person); and Section 15(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (equality before the law).

Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief; an order requiring the government to amend each of its environmental assessment statutes that apply to extant high greenhouse gas emitting projects to allow project approval to be canceled if Canada will be unable to keep its Paris Agreement commitments or considers climate change to be a national emergency; and an order requiring the government to complete an annual account of its cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in a format that allows comparison to Canada's carbon budget. 

The defendant Canada filed a motion to strike on July 28, 2020, and plaintiffs responded to the motion on September 10, 2020.

On November 16, 2020, the Federal Court granted the motion to strike without leave to amend on the grounds that the case was not justiciable, had no reasonable cause of action, and the remedies were not legally available. The Court found that the case was not justiciable because it did not have a sufficient legal component to anchor the analysis. The Court wrote, ""[t]he issue of climate change, while undoubtedly important, is inherently political, not legal, and is of the realm of the executive and legislative branches of government."" The Court further found that because plaintiffs did not reference specific sections of laws that cause specific breaches of Charter rights, their claims presented no reasonable cause of action. With regard to remedies, the Court found that the multifaceted problem of climate change would make judicial supervision meaningless, and therefore the Court could not take on a supervisory role to ensure adequate laws were passed. 

On December 10, 2020, plaintiffs appealed the Federal Court judge's dismissal to the Federal Court of Appeal, and on April 30, 2021, they filed their memorandum of fact and law. Canada responded with their memo of fact on law filed on June 28, 2021.

Greenpeace et al. v. Austria,"On February 20, 2020, Greenpeace Austria and 8,063 petitioners filed a request with the Constitutional Court to invalidate tax exemptions that give credits to air travel and not railways. The request arises out of Article 2 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 2 and Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the principle of equality before the law. The submission also contains a request for preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice regarding the legal nature of Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.

The request asserts that the value-added tax exemption on cross-border flights and the kerosene exemption on national flights contribute to climate change by making it less expensive to fly than to take the train. The petitioners argue that the consequences of the climate crisis pose an imminent and foreseeable threat to their lives, and that Austria has a duty to protect its citizens from these consequences as a party to the Paris Agreement and based on its constitutional duty to protect arising out of the European Convention on Human Rights. Petitioners further argue that the challenged tax exemptions damage the climate and constitute an active infringement of this duty. The petition also alleges that the tax exemptions constitute a preferential treatment for the aviation sector, in violation of the constitutional principle of equality before the law. 

Lastly, the petition includes a request for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice, alleging that while both tax exemptions are allowed for, they are not explicitly provided for in the respective EU directives. This claim asserts that Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights should be interpreted as creating an enforceable right to a high level of environmental protection.

On September 30, 2020 the Constitutional Court dismissed the case on the grounds that rail passengers do not have standing to sue over preferential tax treatment given to air travel.

"In the Matter of the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, SC 2018, c. 12","On February 24, 2020 the Court of Appeal of Alberta found Canada's carbon pricing act unconstitutional. The court reasoned that the act was not a proper exercise of the national government's authority.

Alberta filed suit in June 2019, arguing that the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, SC 2018, c. 12 (the Act) was unconstitutional because it does not fall within the national concern branch of the Parliament's peace, order and good government (POGG) power. The Act imposes a price on greenhouse gases by establishing a ""fuel charge"" on 22 greenhouse gas-emitting fuels, and an out-put based pricing system for industrial emitters.

Ontario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan Power Corporation and SaskEnergy, Inc, intervened in support of Albertas position. They contended that the matter of the Act is properly understood to be the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and that to give the federal government exclusive authority over such a matter under the national concern doctrine would unduly intrude into the provinces jurisdiction to regulate their own natural resources.  Canada responded that it had the authority to enact the Act under the national concern doctrine, arguing that the Act's ""matter"" was in truth ""the establishment of minimal national standards of stringency for GHG emissions pricing to reduce Canada's nationwide GHG emissions."" British Columbia and three nonprofits intervened to support Canada. 

The court ruled for Alberta, concluding that the Act does not fall within the Canadian government's authority under the national concern doctrine. The court explained that the government cannot use the national concern doctrine to commandeer matters assigned exclusively to the provinces.

Fonterra Co-Operative Group Limited,"Michael John Smith (Ngapuhi, Ngati Kahu), climate change spokesperson for the Iwi Chairs' Forum, a Maori development platform, filed a case against seven high-emitting New Zealand companies in the agriculture and energy sectors, including the dairy farming conglomerate Fonterra, oil refinery NZ Refining Company, and petrol seller Z Energy. Smith claimed that the defendants' actions constituted public nuisance, negligence, and breach of a duty to cease contributing to climate change.

On March 6, 2020, the High Court of New Zealand rejected the first two claims, but allowed the third to proceed. The court concluded that Smith could not demonstrate public nuisance because the damage claimed was neither particular to him, nor the direct consequence of the defendants' actions. The court further reasoned that showing a public nuisance was difficult given that the defendants are complying with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The court determined that Smith's negligence claim must fail because he had not shown that the defendants owed him a duty of care, concluding that the damage claimed was not reasonably foreseeable or proximately caused by their actions.

The court declined to strike the third cause of action, which alleged that the defendants had a duty to cease contributing to climate change. The court found that there were ""significant hurdles"" for Smith in persuading the court that this new duty should be recognized, but determined that the relevant issues should be explored at a trial. For instance, the court said perhaps the special damage rule in public nuisance could be modified, and climate science will result in increased ability to model possible effects of emissions. The court warned, however, that it would likely be unable to provide the injunctive relief that Smith seeks, which would require a ""bespoke emission reduction scheme.""

Following the decision of the lower court, Mr Smith appealed the decisions to strike out the first two causes of action, while the defendants cross-appealed the court's decision that the third cause of action should proceed to trial. On October 21st, 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal submitted by Mr Smith and upheld the cross appeal. The court held that tort law was not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with climate change, noting that ""every person in New Zealand  indeed, in the world  is (to varying degrees) both responsible for causing the relevant harm, and the victim of that harm."" The court held that a determination that the conduct of the respondent companies was unlawful would introduce an ""ad hoc"" and ""arbitrary regime"", which would lack democratic legitimacy. The Court of Appeal did, however, note that the courts have some role in climate action: ""in holding the government to account"".

In late 2021, Mr Smith applied for leave to bring an appeal to the New Zealand Supreme Court. On 31 March 2022, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, on the question of whether the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the appeal and allow the cross appeal.",Decided,['New Zealand>High Court of New Zealand'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']",['New Zealand>Common law'],"Plaintiff brought tort claims against GHG emitters, seeking to enjoin polluting activities.

Greenpeace Poland v. PGE GiEK,"On March 11, 2020 Greenpeace Poland filed a lawsuit against PGE GiEK, a subsidiary of state-owned utility PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna, at the Regional Court in odz. According to Greenpeace, the complaint relies on article 323 of the Environmental Protection Law and requests that that PGE GiEK halt any fossil fuel investments and achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions from its existing coal plants by 2030. Article 323 provides, in part, that ""[e]very person who is directly threatened by damage or has suffered damage as a result of illegal impact on the environment may demand that the entity responsible for this threat or violation should restore the state complying with law and take preventive measures.""Greenpeace asserts that PGE Polska Grupa Energetyczna is the largest utility in Poland, and derives about 90% of its electricity from coal.

Do-Hyun Kim et al. v. South Korea,"On March 13, 2020, nineteen youth activists filed a complaint in the South Korean Constitutional Court alleging that the nation's climate change law violates their fundamental rights, including the right to live and a clean environment. South Korea's Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth, which was amended in December 2019, commits to reducing annual nationwide greenhouse gases to 536 million tons by 2030, a 24% cut from 2017. The petitioners argue that this target is insufficient to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. 

The petitioners submitted a supplemental complaint on May 15, 2020, to provide the Court with info on the facts and science of climate change, and, in their view, Korea's insufficient response to the threat.

On September 28, 2020, the petitioners submitted a supplemental brief to provide the Court with updated info on recent severe climate impacts in South Korea, the need for a prompt hearing of the case, and the Irish Supreme Court's handling of a similar case in Friends of the Irish Environment v. Ireland. On January 26, 2021, the petitioners filed a second supplemental brief with arguments on the South Korean government's violation of its obligation to protect citizens from the harms of climate change. The brief argues that the obligation to respond to climate change is derived from the Korean constitution's guarantee of the right to a healthy environment, the obligation to prevent disasters, and the obligation to protect health and safety. Petitioners argue that the government has violated this obligation by failing to enact adequate and effective climate legislation, and that petitioners have standing to challenge legislative omissions due to inadequate protection of environmental rights.

"Poland v. European Parliament, Council of the EU","The European Unions (EU) Directive 2003/87 established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading at the EU level (ETS).  As the ETS developed, it had a growing structural imbalance in the supply and demand of allowances, resulting in an excess that could reach around 2 billion allowances.

In October 2014, the European Council adopted an instrument to stabilize the market as part of the ETS called a ""market stability reserve.  These reserves would not be released unless the total number of allowances in circulation was less than 400 million.  The market stability reserve would result in an increase in the price of emission allowances.  When adopting this measure, the Council did not adopt it under a special legislative procedure pursuant to Article 192(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).  That procedure is required if the Council adopts ""measures significantly affecting a Member State's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.""  

In 2016 Poland filed an application with the European Court of Justice arguing that the decision should be annulled as it should have been adopted under a special legislative procedure.  Poland is particularly reliant on fossil fuels and this decision significantly affects Poland's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.  An increase in emission allowance prices could lead to a change in the competitiveness of various types of power stations and in the structure of electricity production at a national level, and to a decrease in the competitiveness of the energy sector and the Polish economy.  The Court rejected this argument, holding that the aim and content of the contested decision was not to have the primary outcome of significantly affecting Poland's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.

Poland also argued that the European Council had set the date of the application of the market stability reserve at 2021, and that the defendants, by bringing forward the date to 2019, breached article 15 of TEU and infringed the obligation of sincere cooperation.  The Court ruled that there was no reference in the Council's decision to starting the market stability reserve at 2021 and rejected the argument.  Poland also argued the infringement of legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and principle of proportionality, all of which the Court also rejected.

Trinseo v. Federal Republic of Germany,"Trinseo operates an installation for the production of polycarbonate. That installation obtains the steam needed for that production from a plant which is operated, on the same site, by another company, Dow Deutschland Anlagengesellschaft.  On 23 January 2012, Trinseo applied to the German Emissions Trading Authority for the free allocation of emission allowances. By decision of 17 February 2014, the German authority refused that application, on the ground that polycarbonate is not included in the list of substances and groups of substances referred to in the provision of the German legislation transposing Directive 2003/87/CE, which establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community.

On 2 October 2015, Trinseo brought an action against that decision before the Berlin Administrative Court and claimed that the directive at issue shall be interpreted as including in its scope all activities for the production of bulk organic chemicals without any limitation to specific substances. The Administrative Court of Berlin referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) a question regarding the interpretation of Article 1 and Annex I of the Directive 2003/87/CE and its scope of application.

The ECJ observed that, according to Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87, the activities referred to in Annex I of the directive fall within the scope of that directive only if they generate greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the production of polycarbonate by an installation, which imports heat from a third-party installation, does not generate direct emissions of CO2 and cannot rely on the indirect emissions generated by the third-party. The ECJ has therefore ruled that Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as meaning that an installation for the production of polycarbonate, which obtains the heat needed for that production from a third-party installation, does not fall within the scope of the emissions allowance trading scheme established by that directive, since it does not generate direct CO2 emissions. Accordingly, Trinseo is not entitled to free allocation of emissions trading allowances.

INEOS Koln GmbH v Republic of Germany,"INEOS operates a petrochemical plant that incorporates an industrial thermal power plant to provide steam through the combustion of liquid and gaseous waste materials stemming from the manufacturing processes of the site's chemical production facilities.
On January 23, 2012, INEOS applied to the German Emissions Trading Authority for a free allocation of emission allowances, including for process emissions from the combustion of incompletely oxidized carbon from chemical reactions in which the carbon-bearing material participates in the reaction but the primary purpose of which is not heat generation. By decision of February 19, 2014, the German Authority refused to allocate allowances free of charge for process emissions stemming from the combustion of liquid waste, claiming that only gaseous waste is entitled to such emissions according to the German legislation transposing Directive 2003/87/CE, which establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community.

On September 29, 2015, INEOS brought an action against that decision before the Berlin Administrative Court. The company claimed that Article 3(h) of Decision 2011/278 supplementing the Directive does not refer to the physical state of incompletely oxidised carbon and that there is nothing to suggest that the provisions apply solely to waste gases. The Administrative Court of Berlin referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) a question regarding the interpretation of Article 3(h) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU: must it be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which excludes greenhouse gas emissions from the combustion of incompletely oxidized carbon in a liquid state from the category of ""process emissions sub-installation"" which is eligible to the allocation of free allowances?

INEOS Koln GmbH v Republic of Germany,"INEOS operates an installation that produces chemical products and that has been subject to compulsory emissions trading since 2018 through the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS).

On 23 January 2012, INEOS applied to the German Emissions Trading Authority, within the prescribed time limit, for free allocation of emission allowances for their installation for the period 2013-2020. Later, INEOS challenged the German Authoritys decision about how many free emissions allocations to award the company, claiming that it had not considered data relating to direct emissions for 2006 and 2007, which it was required to do. The German Authority claimed it was not required to consider that data, because it had been submitted after the deadline for the initial application. 

On 29 September 2015, INEOS brought an action against that decision before the Berlin Administrative Court. The company argued that it had inadvertently omitted to submit certain data, wrongly assuming that the Authority already had that data. Ineos added that the Authority was under an obligation to ask it to supplement or correct the data provided for the purposes of the allocation application. The Administrative Court of Berlin referred to the ECJ a question regarding the interpretation of Article 10(a) of Directive 2003/87/CE and the provisions of Decision 2011/278: must it be interpreted as precluding national legislation which lays down, for the submission of an application for the free allocation of emission allowances for the period 2013-2020, a deadline by which an applicant must correct or complete its application?

The ECJ ruled that the two directives must not be interpreted as precluding such a national provision and that Germany could impose such a deadline.

Saint-Gobain Glass Deutschland GmbH v European Commission,"Saint-Gobain, a company involved in the world glass market, operates installations covered by Directive 2003/87/EC, which established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community. Saint-Gobain applied to the competent German authorities for the free allocation of emission allowances. The company also submitted a request to the European Commission for access to information regarding some installations in Germany relating to the initial installed capacities, communicated for each sub-installation, and the annual provisional number of free emission allowances allocated to each of those sub-installations. The European Commission denied Saint-Gobains request arguing that Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 provides an exception to the access to environmental information when it can undermine the institutions decision-making process.

On 31 October 2012, Saint-Gobain brought an action against the European Commission decision before the General Court of Justice (EGC), which dismissed the action on 11 December 2014. Saint-Gobain lodged an appeal before the Court of Justice (ECJ) on 11 February 2015.

The ECJ ruled that the exception provided by Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 shall be interpreted in a restrictive way, taking into account the public interest served by disclosure and whether the information requested relates to emissions into the environment. Yet, the fact that the administrative procedure at issue (regarding the free allocation of emission allowances) had not yet been closed on the date of adoption of the contested decision does not in itself establish that disclosure of the documents requested would seriously undermine the Commissions decision-making procedure. The ECJ has therefore annulled the Commissions decision refusing the full access to the documents requested by Saint-Gobain.

Evonik Degussa GmbH v Republic of Germany,"Evonik Degussa operates a hydrogen production installation; it carries out hydrogenation of rich gas and then processes it as part of a pressure-swing adsorption process, in so doing, separating the hydrogen from other substances contained in the rich gas. By decision of 17 February 2014, the German authorities made a decision to allocate Evonik Degussa allowances for the years 2013-2020, which decision made clear that the activity of extracting hydrogen from rich gas was not taken into account for the purposes of the allocation. By decision of 25 August 2015, the German authorities confirmed their original decision on the ground, inter alia, that the hydrogen was already present in the rich gas source streams, and it was not the result of a production by Evonik Degussa. Evonik Degussa appealed this decision before the Administrative Court in Berlin. The dispute in the main proceedings concerns whether the production of hydrogen by purification of rich gases ought to have been taken into account for the allocation of allowances. Evonik Degussa claims it should, relying in particular on the wording of the product benchmark for hydrogen and the definition of that product set out in Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278. 
 
The Administrative Court, Berlin, referred the question to the Court of Justice whether Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278 must be interpreted as meaning that a process element which does not produce hydrogen by chemical synthesis, but only isolates hydrogen already contained in a gas mixture, falls within the system boundaries of the product benchmark for hydrogen.
 
The Court found that Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonized free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council must be interpreted as meaning that a process, such as that at issue here, which does not produce hydrogen by chemical synthesis, but only isolates hydrogen already contained in a gas mixture, does not fall within the system boundaries of the product benchmark for hydrogen. It would be otherwise only if that process: first, is associated with the production of hydrogen within the meaning of Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009; and, second, has a technical connection to the production of hydrogen.

PPC Power v Slovak Financial Directorate,"PPC Power operates an installation in Slovakia that is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). In addition to EU ETS requirements, the government of Slovakia imposed an 80% tax on emissions allowances that were transferred or unused, and therefore allocated free of charge. This tax was applied between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2012.

PPC Power requested that the Tax Administration for Certain Taxpayers, Slovakia (""the DU""), set the amount of the advance of tax payable for 2011 at zero because the legislation establishing the 80% tax rate was incongruous with EU Directive 2003/87/EC. The DU rejected PPC Power's request and set its advance payment amount for the first half of 2011 to EUR300,000. PPC Power applied for repayment of that amount and, when that decision was ultimately rejected by the DU, PPC Power filed suit with the Regional Court of Bratislava, contesting, on the one hand, the decision of the Slovak Republic tax administration rejecting its application for repayment of the advance payment of tax for the first half of 2011 and, on the other, the decision of the DU, setting the amount of advance payment of tax due in respect of the second half of 2011. The Regional Court  referred the question to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), whether Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as precluding national tax legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings.

The ECJ ruled that Directive 2003/87/EC ""must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which taxes, at 80% of their value, greenhouse gas emission allowances allocated free of charge which have been sold or not used by the undertakings subject to the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme."" The ECJ acknowledged that Directive 2003/87/EC requires member states to allocate at least 90% of emissions allowances free of charge but still allows member states to determine procedures for allocating them. However, the ECJ found that, the Slovakian tax eliminated ""virtually all of the economic value of emission allowances,"" and therefore negated the incentive mechanisms underpinning the EU ETS. To reduce emissions in the manner prescribed by the EU ETS, the ECJ ruled, Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as Slovakia's at issue in the proceedings.

Federal Environmental Agency (IBAMA) v. Siderurgica Sao Luiz Ltd. and Martins," In July 2019, Brazils Attorney-Generals Office (Advocacia-Geral da Uniao), representing the Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA), filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against a steel company (Siderurgica Sao Luiz Ltda.) and its managing partner (Mr. Martins), for environmental and climate damages allegedly caused by the companys continuous and fraudulent use of illegally sourced coal in its units in the State of Minas Gerais. 

According to IBAMA, the company falsified the 'certificates of origin for the coal it purchased. IBAMA claims that the company purchased and burned 44,636 cubic meters of coal, fomenting a scheme of illegal deforestation for coal production. 

Highlighting the key role of steel production in the 'life cycle of coal, IBAMA contends that the defendants should be held strictly and jointly liable for the (i) environmental damages resulting from the illegal deforestation (equivalent to an area of approximately 2,231 football fields), and (ii) climate damages resulting from the greenhouse gases emitted from the illegal deforestation, from the conversion of the illegally sourced biomass into coal, and from burning the illegally sourced coal in its steel production.

Based on the National Environmental Policy and National Climate Change Policy (Laws Nos. 6,938/1981 and 12,187/2009, respectively), IBAMA seeks remedies for both environmental and climate damage allegedly caused by the defendants: (i) reforestation of an equivalent area; (ii) compensation for interim and residual environmental damages; (iii) compensation for climate damages based on the social cost of carbon, which should be invested into the creation of carbon sinks; (iv) collective moral damages, to be valued according to the defendants profits from their illegal activities (disgorgement of profits); (v) undertaking of environmental compliance programmes; (vi) unavailability of goods and values as well as loss or restriction of tax benefits and incentives, and loss or suspension of participation in financing lines in official credit establishments.

On February 3, 2021, the magistrate issued a decision rejecting the request for an injunction for the implementation of the environmental integrity program by the steel company and for the suspension of tax incentives or benefits, on the grounds that there is no legal provision imposing the need for the environmental integrity by companies that explore activities potentially harmful to the environment. The decision also states that even in the face of strong evidence that the company committed environmental violations in 2012, it is not possible to impose the requests made by the plaintiff, because it is not known whether the company continues to practice the same acts. In addition, the judge also did not accept the request for blocking or unavailability of assets in the amount of BRL 16,000,000.00 from the company to repair environmental damage, on the understanding that even if there is a causal link as to the company's participation in environmental infractions as a result of the records drawn up by IBAMA, the current moment requires a greater incursion of evidence of the damage caused by the steel company.

On March 2, 2021, the competent judge issued another decision, rejecting the motions for clarification of both parties, on the grounds of the presence of defects and irregularities in the documents.

In re Court on its own motion v. State of Himachal Pradesh and others,"In February 2014, India's National Green Tribunal issued a ruling on its own motion imposing a number of restrictions on activity around the Rohtang Pass, an environmentally sensitive area in the Himalayan state of Himachal Pradesh. 

The National Green Tribunal has jurisdiction pursuant to a a 2010 statute over all civil cases where a substantial question relating to environment ... is involved and such question arises out of [one or more of seven environmental protection statutes enacted between 1974 and 2002]."" The court may initiate cases and impose remedies. In February 2014, on its own motion, the court found that Black Carbon, which can be produced through vehicle use, is a major causative factor for rapid melting of glaciers in the Himalayan region. The court cited a study suggesting that 40% of the glacial retreat could be attributed to Black Carbon impact and concluded that, therefore, Black Carbon emission reduction can address glacial melting. The court concluded that Indian citizens have the right to a wholesome, clean and decent environment, derived from Article 48A of the Constitution (which requires the state to protect and improve the environment), Article 51A (requiring a citizen to protect and improve the natural environment) and Article 21 (protecting the right to life as a fundamental right).

Although the court described how greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming, and affirmed the applicability of the polluter pays principle to the respondents in this case, the court did not assign Himachal Pradesh responsibility for mitigating global warming per se. It did, however, order the government of Himachal Pradesh to undertake sweeping measures to reduce pollution, including random pollution checks, restricting transport in certain areas to compressed natural gas and electric buses, and implementing a reforestation program.

Non-compliance Procedure of Romania under the Kyoto Protocol,"The question of implementation arose with respect to Romanias 2010 annual inventory submission. Consequently, it was found that the Romanian national system did not operate fully in accordance with the general and specific functions as set out in the guidelines for national systems.

Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France et al. v. The Mills of Lohan,"On March 5, 2019, the Administrative Court of Appeal (ACA) of Nantes in France ruled that greenhouse gas reduction achieved by the development of renewable energy constitutes an imperative public interest justifying an exemption from the prohibition on harming protected species.

The case arose out of a 17-turbine wind farm proposed for the prefect of Morbihan. The wind farm was expected to damage part of the forest cover and several protected species. The developer sought an exemption from the prohibition against harming natural habitats and protected animal and plant species under the French Environmental Code. Such an exemption may be granted in the interest of public health and safety or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including of a social or economic nature."" However, case law consistently holds that, even where such a public interest exists, a waiver can only be granted if there is no satisfactory alternative solution and it does not prejudice the maintenance of the affected species.

The prefect of Morbihan granted the waiver. Two local associations -- Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France and Society for the Study and Protection of Nature in Brittany -- along with several local residents brought an action for annulment of this decree. The lower court granted their requests and annulled the order; the ACA then overturned the judgment after the developer appealed. 

The ACA reasoned that the wind farm increases the production of renewable energy, making it easier to meet the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change provided by legislation, by regional planning instruments, by European-level position papers, and by international agreements. The ACA also noted the regions high energy dependency. Thus, taking into account this local context and the need to meet the objectives of developing renewable energy, the court ruled that the project must be considered as meeting an imperative reason of major public interest likely to justify the harm to protected species. The court also analyzed the measures to avoid, reduce, compensate for and monitor the project's impacts on the protected areas, and concluded that their implementation would allow the maintenance of the species concerned in a favorable conservation status.

IPC Petroleum France SA v. France,"On December 18, 2019, the French Administrative Supreme Court upheld a decision to include an expiration date in a fossil fuel mining permit.

In early 2018, IPC Petroleum France SA applied for an extension of its existing fossil fuel extraction permit. The extension was granted, but only until January 1, 2040. Under law n 2017-1839 of December 30, 2017, new research and exploitation of fossil fuels is not allowed in France in light of its Paris Agreement commitments, and existing hydrocarbon mining permits cannot be extended beyond January 1, 2040.

The Company brought this action against the government, alleging that placing an expiration date on its mining permit interfered with the companys right to the peaceful enjoyment of property implied by article 1 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and that the French Mining Code allows a permit to be renewed beyond 2040 for economic reasons.  

The Court dismissed IPC Petroleum France's request, concluding that although the Mining Code does permit a further extension, it provides a precise definition of the appropriate circumstances in which to do so and requires balancing the extension against general public interest. The Court ruled that the January 1, 2040, deadline, more than 20 years after the adoption of the December 30, 2017 law, appropriately balanced the Companys right to enjoy its property against France's commitment to limit climate change.

Packham v. Secretary of State for Transport,"On April 6, 2020, a British court rejected an attempt to halt a railway project on the ground that the project assessment had not adequately considered greenhouse gas emissions. The decision was affirmed on July 31.

Environmental campaigner Christopher Packham filed suit on March 27, 2020 to challenge the Secretary of State for Transport's decision to approve the HS2 rail project, a national high-speed railway network to connect London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. The claimaint sought an interim injunction to prevent imminent clearance works in six different woodlands. He brought a number of claims related to a report analyzing ""whether and how HS2 should proceed."" The claimant alleged, among other things, that the report failed to properly account for expected greenhouse gas emissions during construction of the project; and failed to address the project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions during the period leading up to 2050, and not just in 2050 and beyond, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act 2008. At an April 3 hearing, the court determined that claimant did not have a realistic prospect of success; on April 6 it issued written reasons for its decision. The court rejected all claims, including the claim based on greenhouse gas emissions. 

The court first explained that the report at issue did adequately consider greenhouse gas emissions by assessing the short-term impacts of construction as well as the longer-term effects of providing a mode of transport that is less carbon-intensive than alternatives, such as aviation. The court also rejected the claimant's assertion that the report misrepresented a study by the project's ""nominated undertaker"" by failing to convey that construction emissions would not be at the ""low emissions"" end of the possible range, reasoning that the study simply gave a range of possible greenhouse gas emissions that the report fairly summarized. The court concluded that the defendants, therefore, did not fail to take into account a relevant factor that they were legally required to consider. 

Second, the court dismissed the claimant's argument that both the report assessing H2S and the decision to approve the project failed to address the importance of greenhouse gas emissions in the period leading up to 2050, which is referred to in the Paris Agreement. The court reasoned that the report did consider the effects of the project before and after 2050 resulting from construction and the first 60 years of operation. The court distinguished Plan B Earth v. Secretary of State, in which the Secretary of State admitted that he had not considered the Paris Agreement in approving the expansion of Heathrow Airport. 

On July 31, 2020, the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal, reasoning that none of the claimant's claims were arguable.

Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action Incorporated v. Environmental Protection Authority,"On April 20, 2020, Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action brought a civil enforcement proceeding to compel the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs, represented by the New South Wales Environmental Defenders Office, are Australians who allege that they have been harmed by bush fires made likely or more intense by climate change. The case was brought under the New South Wales Protection of the Environment Operations Act ( 1997 (""PEOA""), which requires the Environmental Protection Authority to develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection."" The summons alleges that, although the New South Wales Climate Change Policy framework endorses the Paris Agreement and contains an aspirational long-term objective to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority has failed to develop guidelines or a policy to regulate greenhouse gases consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. 

On June 4 the respondent filed its points of defense, asserting that it has complied with its duty by developing guidelines and policies from time to time to address greenhouse gas emissions. 

On November 4, 2020, the Court issued an order allowing testimony from the plaintiff's expert, Australian Chief Scientist Professor Penny Sackett, on climate change, including whether emissions trajectories in New South Wales and Australia are on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. According to the plaintiffs, this marks the first time an Australian court has ruled on whether climate evidence can be heard in a case alleging the government's failure to perform their statutory duty. 

On August 26, 2021, the Court ordered the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority (""EPA"") ""to develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection from climate change."" The Court found that the POEA's duty to develop environmental protection instruments includes the duty to develop climate change protection instruments. The Court pointed to evidence presented by Professor Penny Sackett, and the IPCC reports which she relied on, to conclude that ""the threat to the environment of climate change is of sufficiently great magnitude and sufficiently great impact as to be one against which the environment needs to be protected."" The EPA had failed to fulfill its duty to protect from this threat because none of the instruments it presented adequately provided for protection from climate change. The documents it presented were either not prepared by the EPA or were ""directed towards ancillary or insignificant causes or consequences of climate change.""",Decided,['Australia>New South Wales>Land and Environment Court'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],['Australia>Protection of the Environment Operations Act 1997 (NSW)'],Bushfire victims sought to compel greenhouse gas regulation ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/bushfire-survivors-for-climate-action-incorporated-v-environment-protection-authority/
"Market Forces v. SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho","On September 19, 2018, Market Forces filed a complaint with the Japanese National Contact Point (NCP), based on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, alleging that Mizuho Financial Group, Inc. (Mizuho), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) breached the Guidelines with regard to their financing of coal power plants in Vietnam. The complaints allege that SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho are in breach of OECD guidelines because they failed to provide environmental and social impact assessments and consequently failed to urge project sponsors to assess and prevent or minimize environmental damage. They claim that the projects emissions intensity (estimated at 860-880g CO2/kWh) is of an unacceptably high level by international standards, and would generate twice as much CO2 per unit of power generated as the average electricity generating plant in Vietnam. In addition they allege that banks were made aware about the environmental impacts of the project, but there is no evidence that they took any steps to influence their client to disclose additional environmental information or to implement additional mitigation measures that would reduce the projects emissions. Further, they failed to adequately consult communities that were affected by the coal-fired power stations. 

On February 21, 2020, the NCP carried out an initial assessment and decided to further examine the issues raised by Market Forces, except for the issues concerning Vung Ang 2 and the Nam Dinh 1 projects, for which no loan agreements by the enterprises Involved were substantiated. Subsequently, the NCP conducted interviews and decided to hold a dialogue through mediation with the consent of both parties. On July 15, 2020, a dialogue was held online. Regarding Nghi Son 2 coal-fired power project and the Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project, issues related to stakeholder engagement, disclosure obligations, environment, and human rights were discussed. Market Forces requested the enterprises to conduct an independent review on human rights and environment, reinvestigate the process towards the loan agreement, and shift their financing policy in Vietnam to exclude coal-fired projects and help to increase the renewable energy capacity. In response, the enterprises said that they were not directly involved with the projects as they were lenders rather than sponsors or shareholders. Further, they claimed that they were encouraging the project sponsors to honor the environmental and social consideration and stakeholder engagement. While the parties mutually recognized the importance of complying with the Equator Principles and conducting appropriate due diligence, they still had a gap in their position concerning disclosure. During the mediation, the parties did not reach an agreement concerning the issues yet decided to proceed with the final statement without holding a second dialogue.

"BankTrack, et al. vs. ING Bank","BankTrack, Greenpeace Nederland,  Milieudefensie,  Friends of the Earth collectively filed a complaint against ING for failure to commit appropriately to achieving targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement. The complaint alleged that ING had violated environment and consumer interest provisions of the OECD Guidelines by failing to set targets to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases from its financial products. Further, ING had not reported the indirect product emissions of companies and processes that it financed, amounting to a disclosure breach under the guidelines, according to the complaint. 

In its initial assessment, the Dutch NCP accepted the case for further examination, noting the complexity with respect to calculation of CO2 emissions. It opined that this deliberation could purposely enhance the effectiveness of the guidelines. The final statement by the NCP held that ING is obliged under the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises to set climate goals that are aligned with the Paris Agreement. 

Pursuant to the willingness of both parties to participate in mediation, agreement was reached with respect to INGs adoption of the Terra approach, and the PACTA and PCAF methodologies to measure and set targets with respect to the banks climate impact. Further, a collaboration was established between ING, Banktrack, Greenpeace, Milieudefensie, and Oxfam Novib to urge the Dutch Government to request the IAEA to develop response models to limit global warming.

Youth Verdict v. Waratah Coal,"On May 13, 2020, the environmental group Youth Verdict lodged an objection to the proposed Galilee Coal Project in the Queensland Land Court on human rights grounds. The plaintiffs allege that by contributing to climate change, the mine will infringe on their right to life, the protection of children, and the right to culture as protected by the Queensland Human Rights Act. Thus, approval of the mine would be unlawful. The Galilee Coal Project had received federal approval but needed a recommendation that it be approved by the Queensland Land Court before the environmental authority and mining lease could be granted by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science and Minister for Resources, respectively. The recommendations are not finally determinative but must be considered by the Minister for Natural Resources Mines and Energy and by the Chief Executive of the Department of Environment and Science when making a final decision on the mining lease.
 
On August 28, 2020, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. On November 25, 2022, the Queensland Land Court recommended to the Minister for Natural Resources Mines and Energy and the Chief Executive of the Department of Environment and Science that the Mining Lease and Environmental Authority respectively be rejected. In reaching this decision the Court considered factors including climate change, the economic and social benefits and costs and the limitation of human rights associated with the Project.

"Friends of the Irish Environment v. The Government of Ireland, et al.","In April 2020, the Irish High Court dismissed a challenge to Ireland's National Planning Framework (NPF). The plaintiff Friends of the Irish Environment had argued, among other things, that the Government failed to properly analyze the NPF's impact on climate change. 

In February 2018 the Government of Ireland published the NPF which, along with the National Development Plan, maps out the general goals for Ireland for the period leading up to 2040.  In the course of preparing the NPF the Government developed a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Ten National Strategic Outcomes were identified: Compact Growth, Enhanced Regional Accessibility, Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities, High Quality International Connectivity, Sustainable Mobility, A Strong Economy, Enhanced Amenities and Heritage, Transition to Sustainable Energy, Sustainable Management of Water, Waste and other environmental resources, and Access to Quality Child Care, Education and Health Services. The Government determined that a policy option called Regional Effectiveness and Settlement Diversity would best suit the needs of the country in achieving the National Strategic Outcomes while accounting for projected population growth. 

In May 2018, Friends of the Irish Environment filed this action against the Government of Ireland; the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Attorney General. The group challenged the NPF on a number of grounds, including that the Government failed to assess the NPF's effects on climate change when preparing the SEA. The complaint alleged that the government was required to not only identify the likely increases in greenhouse gas emissions that would occur under the NPF, but also analyze the climate impacts of those emissions. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that a quantitative assessment of the NPF's likely effect on climactic factors is not feasible because the NPF is a policy document that does not permit any specific development or project. The court further reasoned that the NPF does contain provisions designed to reduce the effects of climate change that the NPF causes. The court concluded that the SEA's consideration of climate change was therefore sufficient.

Hearing on Climate Change Before the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights,"In September 2019, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights heard presentations from representatives of a number of civil society organizations about the impacts of climate change on the human rights of indigenous peoples, women, children, and rural communities. The organizations stated that human rights impacts can occur during the emission of greenhouse gases, due to the effects of extreme climate events, and in the response to climate change. The July 2019 request for hearing was filed by Fundacion Pachamama (Ecuador), Dejusticia (Colombia), EarthRights International (regional), AIDA (regional), FUNDEPS (Argentina), FIMA (Chile), DPLF (regional), IDL (Peru), CELS (Argentina), Engajamundo (Brazil), AHCC (Honduras), Conectas (Brazil), FARN (Argentina), CEMDA (Mexico), and La Ruta del Clima (Costa Rica). 

The petitioners urged the Commission to recognize the climate crisis as a priority that threatens human rights and ecosystems; advance petitions and precautionary measures related to climate change and its response measures; urge states to protect and guarantee the rights of actors who work to defend human rights; call on states to aim for more ambitious climate action through the 2020 nationally determined contributions; and emphasize the responsibility of businesses to respect human rights in the context of climate change. The organizations further requested that the Commission urge states in the region to take action to stop activities that aggravate climate change and threaten the effective enjoyment of human rights; promote energy transition models that guarantee economic, social, cultural, and environmental rights, especially of indigenous peoples, children and youth, women, and rural communities; take specific measures to guarantee access to information related to the impacts of climate change and its response measures; and promote gender equality. In May 2020 the petitioners published a report regarding their requests.

Fridays for Future Estonia v. Eesti Energia,"In May 2020, the Tartu Administrative Court allowed a complaint by Fridays for Future Estonia (officially MTU Loodusvolu), an organization of young Estonian climate activists, seeking to nullify a permit issued to the state-owned energy group Eesti Energia for the construction of a new shale oil plant. Fridays for Future alleges that the Narva-Joesuu town government issued the construction permit without adequately assessing its climate impacts and the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, as well as the European Union's objective to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The court named two Eesti Energia subsidiaries as third parties, and the Ministry of the Environment as an administrative body.

The court ordered the town to respond to the complaint within 21 days. Two Eesti Energia subsidiaries were named as third parties, and the Ministry of the Environment was named as an administrative body. All three must also present their position within 21 days. Although the court allowed the complaint, it denied a preliminary injunction to halt construction of the plant as not currently justified because the plaintiff's claims relate to impacts that would occur during the plant's operation, rather than construction. 

The courts of first and second instance did not uphold Fridays for Futures complaint, stating that the construction permit does not cover carbon emissions from the use of the oil produced in the plant, but only the impacts of the construction activity itself. They also denied two requests for preliminary injunction to halt construction of the plant as not currently justified because the plaintiff's claims relate to impacts that would occur during the plant's operation, rather than construction. However, the Tartu Circuit Court granted a preliminary injunction in May 2021 and temporarily suspended the construction permit after it appeared that the impacts of the construction to the nearby Natura 2000 area had not been thoroughly assessed. Around two months later the injunction was lifted and the plant is planned to begin operation in early 2024.

In the second half of 2022, the Supreme Court of Estonia accepted the complaint but denied a request for preliminary injunction, and allowed parties to present their positions by mid-March 2023.

"Ecology Action, et al. v. Minister of Environment and Climate Change","On May 11, 2020, on behalf of Ecology Action Centre, Sierra Club Canada Foundation and WWF-Canada, Ecojustice took legal action against the Canadian government, alleging a failure to properly assess the risks of exploratory drilling for oil and gas off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. The application for review asserts that the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada relied on a deficient assessment report in completing its regional assessment of offshore exploratory drilling in the region under the Impact Assessment Act. The complainants contend, among other things, that an increase in offshore oil and gas exploration threatens Canada's commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. 

The complaint seeks an order declaring that the report is not a ""regional assessment"" within the meaning of the Impact Assessment Act, an order quashing the report and sending it back to the Regional Assessment Committee for the Regional Assessment of Offshore Oil and Gas Exploratory Drilling East of Newfoundland and Labrador to redo the assessment, an order prohibiting the Minister of Environment and Climate Change from making a regulation based on the report to exempt from assessment under the Act certain exploratory drilling activities, and an interim order staying the effect of the proposed regulation. The government filed a motion to dismiss. On June 3, a federal court in Ottawa denied the motion to dismiss, and denied the complainants' motion for an interim order.

"Vince et al. v. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy et al.","On May 18, 2020, three plaintiffs sought judicial review of the British government's energy national policy statements (Energy NPSs) issued in 2011 on the ground that the NPSs must be reevaluated in light of new British and global climate commitments. 

The plaintiffs are Dale Vince, founder of a renewable energy company called Ecotricity; journalist and campaigner George Monbiot; and the organization Good Law Project. On March 2 the plaintiffs sent a letter to the Secretaries of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy; Housing, Communities, and Local Government; and Environment, Farming and Rural Affairs. The letter urged the Secretaries to consider whether the Energy NPSs are still appropriate under section 6(1) of the Planning Act 2008 in light of changed circumstances. These changed circumstances include an amendment to the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment), in June 2019, to require that the UK achieves carbon neutrality by 2050; the Paris Agreement; the IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees of warming; the UK Parliament's declaration of a climate emergency; and the UK's exit from the European Union. The government responded on March 23 that it was considering whether to review the Energy NPSs. 

On May 18 the plaintiffs sought judicial review. The plaintiffs argue that the events discussed above constitute a significant change in circumstances since the Energy NPSs were adopted in 2011, requiring review of the NPSs. The plaintiffs alternatively argue that the Secretaries of State may not exercise their discretion to frustrate the operations of Any Act of Parliament, and that the current Energy NPSs frustrate the intent of the Climate Change Act 2008 as amended in 2019. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that the government must review the Energy NPSs; or, alternatively, a declaration that the Energy NPSs are unlawful. The plaintiffs filed an amended summons on June 29, 2020.

PSB et al. v. Brazil (on Amazon Fund),"On June 5th, 2020, four political parties filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality for Omission (ADI-O), before the Federal Supreme Court (STF), challenging the Federal government's alleged failure to adopt administrative measures concerning the Amazon Fund.

The Amazon Fund, created by the Decree 6,527/08, has the objective of promoting projects that prevent or combat deforestation and finances actions for the Reduction of Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD +) mechanism, under the UNFCCC. The plaintiffs claim that the fund has not approved any project since 2019, although resources are available and projects are awaiting technical analysis. They further allege that between 2019 and 2020, important mechanisms that allowed the functioning and management of the Amazon Fund were extinguished, namely: the Technical Committee of the Amazon Fund (CTFA), responsible for calculating deforestation and the amount of carbon emitted, and the Steering Committee of the Amazon Fund (COFA), the Fund's governance body.

The plaintiffs rely on the common duty of the Federal Government, the States, the Federal District and the Municipalities to protect the environment and fight pollution in any of its forms and to preserve forests, fauna and flora per the Federal Constitution of 1988, as well as the precautionary principle. They also allege a violation of Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, regarding the State's duties to: preserve and restore ecological processes; promote the ecological management of ecosystems; define territorial spaces and its components to be specially protected; and protect fauna and flora. The petition also seeks an injunction to require that Federal Union take the necessary administrative measures to reactivate the operation of the Amazon Fund.

In June 2020 the Supreme Court admitted the lawsuit and requested the federal and state government actors involved to provide information related to: (i) the management and distribution of Fund resources; (ii) activities and projects linked to the Fund that have been implemented and suspended; (iii) data on the deforestation process observed in the Amazon region between 2013 and 2020; and (iv) contracts signed with international donors (Germany and Norway).

The Public Attorneys Office (Advocacia-Geral da Uniao, AGU), in the defense of the Federal Government, presented a response stating that the ADI-O would not be a suitable instrument for demonstrating discontent or disagreement with the content of government actions.

On June 26, 2020, the National Development Bank (BNDES), which manages the Amazon Fund, sent information about the resources and projects linked to it. Several NGOs were admitted as amicus curiae by Minister Rosa Weber. On October 23, 2020, Minister Rosa Weber held a public hearing to specify the arguments that underlie ADO 59, in addition to discussing the factual, statistical and normative contexts that permeate the protection and preservation of the Legal Amazon, through the Fund Amazon.

On March 18, 2022, the minister and president of the STF, Luiz Fux, admitted seven environmental cases on the agenda for March 30, 2022 (including two climate cases, this case and <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/brazilian-socialist-party-and-others-v-brazil/"">ADPF760</a>). This move by the STF is considered  historical, and was called the ""green agenda."" On November 3, 2022, the STF determined that the federal government shall, within 60 days, adopt all of the administrative tasks necessary to reactivate the Amazon Fund. The court decided that the decrees that altered the functioning of the Fund and interrupted the funding of new projects were unconstitutional. The court further found that the unilateral extinction of the committee without creating a substituting body was an omission in the government's duty to protect the Amazon rainforest. ",Pending,['Brazil>Federal Supreme Court'],['Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems'],['Brazil>Constitution of 1988'],Four political parties filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutional Omission before the Federal Supreme Court to compel the Ministry of the Environment to resume the activities of the Amazon Fund.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/psb-et-al-v-brazil/
PSB et al. v. Brazil (on Climate Fund),"On June 5, 2020, four political parties filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality for Omission, before the Federal Supreme Court to challenge the Federal Union's alleged failure to adopt administrative measures concerning the Climate Fund. The National Climate Change Fund (Fundo Clima), created by Law 12.114/2009, is an instrument of the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC, Law 12.187/2009) and aims to ensure that resources support projects or studies and finances activities aimed at mitigating and adapting to climate change and its effects.

The plaintiffs allege that although there is a legal obligation for the Ministry of the Environment to prepare an annual plan for the Climate Fund, it has been inoperative since 2019. The petitioners rely on the obligation of the Union, the States, the Federal District and the Municipalities to protect the environment and fight pollution in any of its forms and to preserve forests, fauna and flora per the Federal Constitution, as well as the precautionary principle. The plaintiffs also allege a violation of Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, regarding the State's duties to: preserve and restore ecological processes; promote the ecological management of ecosystems; define territorial spaces and its components to be specially protected; and protect fauna and flora. The petition also seeks an injunction to require that the Federal Union: (i) undertake the necessary administrative measures to reactivate the operation of the Climate Fund, with the due availability of resources related to the Climate Fund (including the non-refundable and refundable modalities); (ii) prepare and present the appropriate annual plans for the application of the Fund's resources; and (iii) refrain from making new contingencies of resources from the Climate Fund.

The preliminary ruling by the Supreme Federal Court: (i) adopted an urgency procedure for the action; (ii) summoned the governmental actors involved; (iii) admitted the action as an Argument for Failure to Comply with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF, another constitutional procedure aimed at enforcing the principles and values in the Constitution); and (iv) scheduled a public hearing on September 21 and 22, 2020, creating a deadline for interested parties to express their interest in participating, until August 10, 2020.

Subsequently, Minister Luis Roberto Barroso issued an order determining that the participation of all interested parties that met the criteria of i) representativeness, (ii) technical specialization and expertise of the exhibitor would be admitted; and (iii) guaranteeing plurality in the composition of the audience and different points of view to be defended. On February 2, 2021, the Court ordered the Federal Government and the Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDS) to be summoned to submit information on the resources allocated to the Climate Fund and on the total amount spent on projects and financing linked to the Climate Fund.

On May 3, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the preliminary injunction requested by the Brazilian Socialist Party, on the grounds that the request for suspension of funding for the Lixo Zero project by the Union was based on generic irregularities that did not allow confirmation of the concrete veracity of the situation.

On June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court rejected the governments arguments and ruled that the executive branch cannot ignore the mandate of the legislative branch. Instead, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to execute and allocate the funds of the Climate Fund to mitigate climate change, based on both the separation of powers and the constitutional right to a healthy environment. The court further found that the judiciary, in turn, must act to avoid the regression of environmental protection. The Supreme Court clarified that environmental law treaties constitute a particular type of human rights treaty, which enjoy supranational status. This supralegality of human rights treaties means that they are above regular laws in the legal hierarchy. Accordingly, any Brazilian law or decree that contradicts the Paris Agreement, including the nationally determined contribution, may be invalidated. Any action or omission contrary to this protection is a direct violation of the Constitution and human rights. The constitutional duty to allocate the funds effectively means that there is a duty to mitigate climate change considering the international commitments under the climate change framework.

Development YES  Open-Pit Mines NO v. Group PZU S.A.,"Development YES, a grassroots foundation working on anti-coal and anti-lignite activism in Poland, filed a specific instance against PZU in August 2018. The complaint concerned the indirect impact of the activities of PZU on climate change and lack of transparency in information regarding PZUs CO2 emissions and the impact of financially insuring the coal mining sector in Poland.

The Polish National Contact Point for OECD Guideines for Multinational Enterprises (NCP) in its initial assessment accepted the case and directed the parties to proceedings. Although the NCP classified the initial assessment and the proceedings until the final assessment, it advised against adopting such  practice.

Both parties were willing to engage in dialogue, and PZU submitted a letter committing to publish information relating to the environmental impact of its activities in their 2018 non-financial report. Subsequently Development-YES and PZU reached an agreement in April 2019. 

In its final assessment, the Polish NCP recommended PZU to continue to honour commitments made to Development-YES, with particular regard to disclosing relevant non-financial information in the future and adopting policies that respect human rights and the environment.

"Neubauer, et al. v. Germany","In February 2020, a group of German youth filed a legal challenge to Germany's Federal Climate Protection Act (Bundesklimaschutzgesetz or KSG) in the Federal Constitutional Court, arguing that the KSG's target of reducing GHGs by 55% until 2030 from 1990 levels was insufficient. The complainants alleged that the KSG therefore violated their human rights as protected by the Basic Law, Germany's constitution.

The complainants alleged that the KSG's 2030 target did not take into account Germany's and the EU's obligation under the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to ""well below 2 degrees Celsius."" The complainants argued that in order to ""do its part"" to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, Germany would need to reduce GHGs by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030. Their claims mainly arose out of alleged violations of the fundamental right to a future consistent with human dignity enshrined in Article 1 (1), and the fundamental right to life and physical integrity enshrined in Article 2 (2) of the Basic Law, both in conjunction with Article 20a of the Basic Law, which binds the political process to protect the natural foundations of life in responsibility for future generations. Complainants argued that by requiring insufficient short and medium term GHG reductions and allowing for the transfer of emission allocations between Germany and other EU Member States, despite the inadequacy of the overall EU emissions reduction target, the KSG allowed for climate impacts that violate their fundamental rights.

The complainants asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare that the German legislature violated the Basic Law by only requiring a 55% reduction in GHGs from 1990 levels by 2030 and to declare that the legislature was required to issue new reduction quotas to ensure that Germany's emissions are kept as low as possible, taking into account the principle of proportionality.

Three other groups of claimants filed simultaneous constitutional complaints targeting the governments climate protection measures: (i) BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany) and the Association of Solar Supporters and Others in November 2018; (ii) Yi Yi Prue and other individuals from Bangladesh and Nepal in January 2020; (iii) Steinmetz and other individual German youths in January 2020. The Constitutional Court decided jointly on these complaints. 

On April 29, 2021, the Federal Constitutional Court published its decision striking down parts of the KSG as incompatible with fundamental rights for failing to set sufficient provisions for emission cuts beyond 2030. The Court found that Article 20a of the Basic Law not only obliges the legislature to protect the climate and aim towards achieving climate neutrality, but also concerns how environmental burdens are spread out between different generations. For the first time in its jurisprudence, the Court stated that the fundamental rights - as intertemporal guarantees of freedom - afford protection against the greenhouse gas reduction burdens imposed by Art. 20a of the Basic Law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future. It further stated that the KSGs emission provisions in question constituted an advance interference-like effect, which possibly violates the complainants fundamental rights and thus renders the complaints admissible.

Accepting arguments that the legislature must follow a carbon budget approach to limit warming to well below 2C and, if possible, to 1.5C, the Court found that legislature had not proportionally distributed the budget between current and future generations, writing ""one generation must not be allowed to consume large portions of the CO2 budget while bearing a relatively minor share of the reduction effort, if this would involve leaving subsequent generations with a drastic reduction burden and expose their lives to serious losses of freedom. The Court also noted that the fact that no state can resolve the problems of climate change on its own (...) does not invalidate the national obligation to take climate action. 

The Court ordered the legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets from 2031 onward by the end of 2022. In response to the decision, the federal lawmakers passed a bill approving an adapted KSG that requires, at a minimum, reduction of 65% in GHGs from 1990 levels by 2030.

"Asociacion Civil por la Justicia Ambiental v. Province of Entre Rios, et al. (Delta del Parana case)","In late Fall 2020, the uncontrolled burning of pastures in a Ramsars wetland ecosystem (Delta del Parana) created a serious environmental conflict between different provinces of Argentina. This conflict gave place to several lawsuits seeking protection for the ecosystem, including injunctions and damages for environmental and health consequences of the fires. One of these claims introduced climate concerns.

On July 03, 2020, two NGOs and a group of children represented by their parents filed a constitutional collective claim (amparo colectivo ambiental) against three Argentinean Provinces and a Municipality. The plaintiffs allege that the government entities are failing in their duties regarding the protection and sound environmental management of the inter-jurisdictional ecosystem, which is key for mitigation and adaptation of climate change while also being at risk due to its negative impacts. The complaint asks the Supreme Court to (i) declare the ecosystem as an entity subject to rights, (ii) order the defendants to prepare and implement a coordinated environmental management and land use plan that recognizes the vulnerability of the ecosystem and its relevance for future generations, (iii) designate a guardian for the entity, responsible for monitoring its conservation and sustainable use, as well as informing the Supreme Court about the enforcement of the judgment, and (iv) order that broad, early and effective public participation is guaranteed in any decision-making regarding the future management of the ecosystem. The complaint relies primarily on the Argentinian constitution, the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, General Environmental Law No. 25.675 and Environmental Law to Control Burning Activities No. 23.919. The complaint also references laws in other countries recognizing the rights of nature, rivers, and other non-human entities. 

On 11 August 2020, the Supreme Court made a first decision in one related case (Equistica Defensa del Medio Ambiente v. Provincia de Santa Fe y ots). In the decision, the Supreme Court referred to Law 27.520 (Climate Change Adaptation and Mitigation Law) as a principal Law for the case and ordered the creation of an Environmental Emergency Committee and the submission of relevant information about the environmental problem and its management.

O'Donnell v. Commonwealth,"On July 22, 2020, Equity Generation Lawyers filed a lawsuit in the Federal Court on behalf of Kathleen (Katta) O'Donnell against the Australian government. The lawsuit alleges that Australia's economy and reputation in international financial markets will be significantly affected by the adequacy of the Australian governments response to climate change, and that as a result investors who trade in Australian government bonds face material risks from climate change that should be disclosed. The lawsuit further alleges that the government has misled or deceived investors and continues to mislead or deceive investors in failing to disclose such risks.

O'Donnell seeks to represent other holders of and investors in Exchange-traded Australian Government Bonds who have the same interest in the proceeding. She seeks declarations that the Commonwealth has breached the law and an injunction to prevent further promotion of bonds without informing investors about climate change risks.

The Australian Government sought to strike out the claim in its entirety at a one-day hearing on July 29, 2021. It argued that the applicant had failed to sufficiently articulate precisely what risks should be disclosed. In the strike-out judgment handed down October 8, 2021, the Court rejected this argument and refused the Governments application to disband the class action. The Court permitted the claim of misleading or deceptive conduct to proceed. However, the applicants claims with respect to duty of care and against the Commonwealth officials were struck out.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Stralsund Mining Authority,"On July 27, 2020, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) filed an action against the Stralsund Mining Authority in the supreme administrative court of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. DUH sought reconsideration of the Authority's January 2018 decision to issue a permit for Russian-owned Gazprom's Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. DUH asked the court to oblige the Authority to review the permit in the context of related (direct and indirect) methane emissions, arguing that a significant upward revision of estimated methane emissions from gas production and transportation has occurred since the permit was first granted in January 2018. Alternatively, DUH requested that the court suspend the permit and refer the case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling regarding compliance with the European precautionary principle.

On November 16, 2021, the court ruled the DUH complaint against the Stralsund Mining Authority partly inadmissible, partly unsubstantiated. According to the court, DUH lacked the necessary legal protection with regard to the offshore pipeline running in the territory of the Federal Republic of Germany and the onshore facilities in Lubmin, as well as the offshore pipeline, rendering the complaint inadmissible on these points. In the preliminary stages, the plant, which had not yet started operating, had already been tested for gas tightness in accordance with the technical safety regulations. With regard to the associated Russian gas infrastructure on land, the court found the complaint admissible but unfounded. According to the court, the planning approval decision had assessed the environmental impacts as a whole, in particular methane emissions, and had not left them to a later decision.",Decided,['Germany>Supreme administrative court of the State of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],['Germany>Administrative Law'],Environmental group challenged natural gas pipeline permit.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/duetsche-umwelthilfe-v-stralsund-mining-authority/
0907346 [2009] RRTA 1168,"The applicant sought review of the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship delegates decision to refuse to grant the applicant a Protection (Class XA) visa under s.65 of the Migration Act 1958. The applicant claimed to be a citizen of Kirbati, which is a pacific country made of a series of islands threatened by sea level rise. The applicant had last arrived in Australia in December 2007 and applied for the visa in May 2009. The delegate decided to refuse the visa in August 2009. The applicant applied for a review of the decision in September 2009. 

Australia is a party to the Refugees Convention, which defines a refugee as: being outside his country; fearing persecution involving serious harm and systematic and discriminatory conduct; fearing that persecution because of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion; and having that fear be well-founded.

The applicant claimed that some of the Kirbati islands are disappearing due to climate change and sea-level rise, and the future of the country is disappearing due to climate change. The applicant claimed that the main livelihood is ruined and destroyed on the islands, as well as the freshwater supply. The Court found that the continued production of carbon emissions that cause climate change is not sufficient to constitute persecution under the Refugee Convention in a decision issued on December 10, 2009 as there was no evidence that the persecution the applicant was fearing was occurring because of his membership to any particular group.

Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) v Commonwealth Bank of Australia,"The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility filed an application of October 14, 2014 against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, seeking declarations that their proposed resolutions relating to greenhouse gas emissions could be validly moved at the annual general meeting of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia pursuant to s 249N of the Corporations Act 2001. 

The resolutions included requiring the company to create and release a report detailing their greenhouse gas emissions and plans to mitigate the emissions, and requiring the company to create and release a report detailing the risks posed by climate change to the bank and mitigation strategies the bank would adopt. 

The Court rejected the proposed resolutions under the Corporations Act in a judgment issued on July 31, 2015. The Court found that shareholders do not have the authority to propose resolutions that relate to the management of a company unless the companys constitution so allows.

Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated v Minister for the Environment and Energy,"The Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated filed a judicial review challenge in a suit against the Minister for the Environment and Energy and Adani over the development of a coal mine in the lower suit. The ACF appealed the decision dismissing the judicial review challenge. Adani proposed to develop and operate a coal mine and associated infrastructure in Central Queensland. The ACF alleged error by the Minister in failing to determine the impact of combustion emissions on the Great Barrier Reef under s 527E of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Minister had approved the coal mine project on October 14, 2015. 
The Act requires consideration of the proposal in connection with, among other things, its effects upon the environment. There is a prohibition upon the taking of action that has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. The ACF claimed that the Minister made an error of law in failing to consider the effect of emissions from transport by rail, shipping, and combustion of the product coal overseas, in characterising these emissions as not a direct consequence of the proposed action, and in failing to consider or apply the precautionary principle in relation to the possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance. The court upheld the lower courts findings that the Ministers reasons reflected a proper discharge of his statutory duty in a judgement issued on August 25, 2017.

However, in a judgement issued December 15, 2017, the Court accepted that matters concerning the Reef and climate change were important to Australians. It ordered that the appellant pay each respondents costs of the appeal.

Cherry Tree Wind Farm Pty Ltd v Mitchell Shire Council,"Cherry Tree Wind Farm Pty Ltd applied to review a decision by the Mitchell Shire Council to fail to grant an application for a wind farm. The application had been denied because the consent of two landowners who were constructing dwellings within 2 kilometers of the proposed turbine had not been obtained. The Tribunal decided to adjourn the final determination for the matter pending the outcome of a study to be conducted by the EPA of South Australia in an order dated April 4, 2013. 

In hearings between January 29 and March 18, 2013, the Tribunal considered state policy on renewable energy, as well as potential health problems of the sound pressure emissions from the farm. The tribunal decided that their deliberations must start with the proposition that renewable energy facilities, including wind farms, should be encouraged and promoted. As such, the Tribunal determined that its role was to strike a balance with the renewable energy facilities to achieve minimal impact to the area.

Dunford v Gosford City Council,"In hearings held from December 9 to December 11, 2014, Esther Dunford appealed the refusal by Gosford City Council for the demolition of an existing dwelling and the construction of a new dwelling in Wamberal. The Council denied the application because the new construction would not properly avoid the potential risk of coastal erosion and therefore is against public interest. The court considered whether coastal hazard processes would result in unacceptable property damage and loss, and that the risk to development along the cost was projected to rise due to projected sea level rises. 

In a decision issued on January 14, 2015, the appeal was upheld. The Commissioner found that coastal hazards were appropriately taken into consideration in the proposed development. There was disagreement over whether there would be a need for a revetment wall. The Commissioner agreed with the applicants expert that one was not per se required to sufficiently minimize the potential risk from coastal erosion. The Commissioner also found that there was no basis to say that there would be a view loss to existing neighboring residences.

EH v Queensland Police Service; GS v Queensland Police Service,"On August 28, 2020, the Queensland District Court overturned the convictions of two climate protesters for using ""locking"" devices to obstruct a railway to a coal mine, concluding that the convictions and sentences were overly harsh under the circumstances. 

During the 2019-2020 bushfires in Australia, the two defendants traveled to Queensland to protest the proposed expansion of coal mines in the Bowen basin. The protesters blocked a railway line that provides access to a coal loading facility by using tubular steel attachment devices to ""lock"" themselves to a 44 gallon drum filled with concrete, creating a device known as a ""dragon's den."" The devices can only be released voluntarily, or if someone else cuts the device, and cutting the device risks injury to the protesters. The defendants were charged with obstructing a railway; trespassing on a railway; using a dangerous attachment device to interfere with transport infrastructure; and contravening a direction or requirement. The dangerous attachment device offense was a new offense created by 2019 legislation that prohibits the use of devices such as ""dragon dens,"" which was introduced in response to protests against coal mining and regarding climate change. The Acting Magistrate convicted and sentenced the defendants to three months imprisonment for that offense. Convictions were not recorded for the other offenses. 

On appeal, the district court concluded that the device the protesters used fell within the definition of a ""dragon's den,"" but that the gravity of the offense was minimal given the lack of evidence that any loss was suffered, that members of the public were burdened, or that there was violence or the threat of violence. The court further explained that the defendants ""have the right to express their views and to protest against an activity to which they object subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for (amongst other legitimate aims) the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,"" and that ""the motive for the commission of the offen[s]e will often be relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, the weight to given to personal deterrence and it may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence."" The court accordingly allowed the appeal, vacated the convictions and resentenced the defendants to a single fine of $1000.

Duarte Agostinho and Others v. Portugal and 32 Other States,"On September 2, 2020, six Portuguese youth filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights against 33 countries. The complaint alleges that the respondents have violated human rights by failing to take sufficient action on climate change, and seeks an order requiring them to take more ambitious action. 

The complaint relies on Articles 2, 8, and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protect the right to life, right to privacy, and right to not experience discrimination. The complainants claim that their right to life is threatened by the effects of climate change in Portugal such as forest fires; that their right to privacy includes their physical and mental wellbeing, which is threatened by heatwaves that force them to spend more time indoors; and that as young people, they stand to experience the worst effects of climate change. 

The case is brought against the Member States of the Council of Europe (Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Germany, Greece, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Croatia, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Latvia, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain and Sweden) as well as Norway, Russia, Switzerland, Turkey, Ukraine and the United Kingdom. The complainants allege that the respondents have fallen short of their human rights obligations by failing to agree to emissions reductions that will keep temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as envisioned by the Paris Agreement. 

On November 30, 2020, The European Court of Human Rights fast-tracked and communicated the case to 33 defendant countries, requiring them to respond by the end of February 2021. According to the Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), who are supporting the case, only a tiny minority of cases before the Court are fast-tracked and communicated. 

On February 4, 2021, the Court rejected a motion by the defendant governments asking the Court to overturn its fast-tracking decision. The governments had asked the court to overturn priority treatment of the case and to hear arguments only on the admissibility of the case. The Court sent a letter to the parties rejecting these motions and gave the defendants until May 27, 2021 to submit a defense on both admissibility and the merits of the case. 

The Court also granted until May 6, 2021 third party interventions. Among other seven third-party intervention, on May 5, 2021, Amnesty International intervened in the case and submitted her written observations to the European Court of Human Rights. The submission supports the claimants' position, providing legal arguments to the Court to show that international law requires states to not harm, and to not allow companies within their jurisdiction to harm, the human rights of people outside their borders.

On May 19, 2021 a new intervention was made by the European Commission submitted her written observations to the European Court of Human Rights. Noting the pronounced impact of environmental degradation and climate change on human rights, the Commissioner argues that international environmental and childrens rights law instruments should play a significant role in defining the scope of states obligation to prevent human rights violations caused by environmental harm. The Commission bases its defense of EU policy in the field of environmental protection on sound legal reasoning and science-based evidence. The term climate emergency expresses the political will to fulfill the obligations under the Paris Agreement.  The Commissioner concludes that the increasing number of climate change-related applications provide the Court with a unique opportunity to continue to forge the legal path towards a more complete implementation of the Convention and to offer real-life protection to individuals affected by environmental degradation and climate change.

On August 14, 2021, the claimants received the respondent governments respective defenses. However, on legal advice, the claimants have decided not to make them public. The claimants have until January 12, 2022 to respond to the governments defenses. 

On June 30, 2022, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights relinquished jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber. The case is now going to be examined by the ECtHR's Grand Chamber of 17 judges on account of the fact that the case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation of the Convention (Art 30 ECHR).",Pending,['European Court of Human Rights'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other'],['European Convention on Human Rights'],Youth filed human rights complaint against 33 governments. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/youth-for-climate-justice-v-austria-et-al/
Corporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association v. Attorney General of Ontario,"On September 4, 2020, an Ontario court struck down legislation requiring gas pumps to post notices informing customers that Canada's carbon pricing scheme will ""cost"" them.

In 2018 Canada enacted the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, which imposed a nationwide price on carbon. In May 2019, the Ontario Legislature enacted the Federal Carbon Tax Transparency Act, which required that a notice explaining certain fuel charges be posted on every gas pump in every gas station in Ontario. The notice stated ""the federal carbon tax will cost you,"" with a graph showing costs to consumers rising through 2022. Corporation of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) brought suit seeking a declaration that the legislation violated the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.

The Court concluded that CCLA had public interest standing to bring the action, particularly because the group had tried to find a gas retailer to act as a co-plaintiff. The Court then concluded that the required notice adversely affected expression. Moreover, the Court reasoned, the notice was ""inaccurate in a way that the Ontario government well knows"" because the carbon pricing act serves a regulatory rather than a revenue-raising purpose, and so it is not a tax. Finally, the Court held that the notice's infringement on free speech was not justified because it served more to advance a partisan message than to share information with the public. The Court ordered the gas retailers may but do not need to keep the notices on their fuel pumps.",Decided,['Canada>Ontario>Superior Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>Access to information'],['Canada>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms'],"Whether local law requiring stickers on gas pumps about ""carbon tax"" violated free speech.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/corporation-of-the-canadian-civil-liberties-association-v-attorney-general-of-ontario/
Youth v. Government of Mexico,"On September 2, 2020, fifteen young people from the State of Baja, California filed a federal lawsuit against the Mexican Government. According to the plaintiffs, the lawsuit was filed and admitted in a District Court in Administrative Matters and asks that the Mexican government issue regulations and public policies derived from the General Law on Climate Change and the Mexican Constitution. The General Law on Climate Change was passed in 2012 but, according to the plaintiffs, there are no regulations or public policies to implement the statute. 

On May 20, 2022, the District Court dismissed the case for a lack of standing. The Court argued that the plaintiffs did not prove that the lack of climate change regulations and public policies that derived from the General Law on Climate Change and the Mexican Constitution directly violated the plaintiffs human rights. Furthermore, the Court considered that the plaintiffs did not prove that they are in a situation that differentiates them from the rest of society, which is a procedural requirement of an amparo lawsuit. Therefore, the case was dismissed.

Sharma and others v. Minister for the Environment,"On September 8, 2020, eight young people filed a putative class action in Australia's Federal Court to block a coal project. The lawsuit sought an injunction to stop the Australian Government from approving an extension of the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine. The plaintiffs claimed to represent all people under 18, and argued that Federal Minister Sussan Ley has a common law duty of care for young people. They further asserted that digging up and burning coal will exacerbate climate change and harm young people in the future. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the Minister from approving the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). 

On May 27, 2021, the Federal Court of Australia established a new duty of care to avoid causing personal harm to children but declined to issue an injunction to force the Minister to block the coal mine extension. The Court concluded that ""the applicants have established that the Minister has a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing personal injury to the Children when deciding, under s 130 and s 133 of the EPBC Act, to approve or not approve the Extension Project."" In establishing the duty of care, the Court found that the foreseeable harm from the project, if the risks were to come true, would be ""catastrophic"", and therefore children should be considered persons who would be so directly affected that the Minister ought to consider their interests when making the approval decision. In declining to issue an injunction, the Court found that the plaintiffs had not established that it is probable that the Minister would breach the duty of care in making the approval decision, and had not established that they will have no further opportunity to apply for an injunction. In its May 27, 2021 judgment, the Court delayed issuing a declaration about the duty of care owed by the minister, and raised a number of questions to the parties about the scope of the duty.

On July 8, 2021, the Court issued a declaration that ""The [Minister] has a duty to take reasonable care . . . to avoid causing personal injury or death to persons who were under 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in Australia at the time of the commencement of this proceeding arising from emissions of carbon dioxide into the Earths atmosphere."" In issuing the declaration, the Court rejected arguments by the Minister to limit the declaration to only the applicants. Instead, the Court declared the duty applied to all Australian young people because both the applicants and Australian young people had the ""same interest."" The Court ordered the Minister to pay costs. 

On September 13, 2021, the Ministry of Environment filled an appeal questioning the judges finding that the Minister owes a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to children related to anthropogenic climate change. The appeal is based on the separation of powers and the argument that the Ministers decision is a matter of policy and subject to discretion. The regulation of GHG emissions is better suited for the Executive, and no novel duty of care should be recognized. The appeal also questioned whether the approved project would cause a net increase in global GHG emissions and the reversed onus of proof in approaching this issue. 

Despite the Federal Courts decision, on September 15, 2021, the Minister granted approval for the proposed mine expansion. A hearing was held on October 18-20, 2021. On March 15, 2022, the Full Federal Court of Australia unanimously overturned the primary judges decision to impose a duty of care on the Minister. The three judges had separate reasonings. Chief Justice Allsop found that the duty would require consideration of questions of policy unsuitable for the judicial branch to resolve. Justice Beach found insufficient closeness between the Minister and the children but left open the possibility of a future claim if any of the children suffered damage. Justice Wheelahan found that (i) the EPBC Act cannot establish a duty of care relationship between the Minister and children, (ii) establishing a duty would be incoherent with the Ministers functions under the EPBC Act and (iii) it was not foreseeable that approval of the coal mine extension would cause personal injury to the children. Despite allowing the Ministers appeal, the Court rejected the Ministers argument that the primary judge made findings based on evidence of climate change that were unfounded. This means that the primary judge's findings of fact about the risk of harm of climate change to children remain. The Full Federal Court noted that the nature of the risks and the dangers from global warming, including the possible catastrophe that may engulf the world and humanity were never in dispute. 

The plaintiffs announced that they would not appeal the decision. 

The plaintiffs asked the court to make orders that the proceeding not continue as a representative proceeding. 

The Full Court was of the view that before orders were made setting aside the orders of the Court
made by the primary judge and dismissing the amended originating application dated 14
December 2020, the parties should be afforded an opportunity to consider whether any further
orders were appropriate or necessary to address the representative nature of the proceeding. This is because the proceedings in their current form would bind the represented children (all Australians under the age of 18 at the time the case was filed), and give rise to an issue estoppel in relation to all questions of fact and law necessary to the Full Courts conclusion that the Minister did not owe the posited duty of care. This would prevent the represented children from bringing proceedings of a similar nature in the future. 

Accordingly, the parties asked the court to make orders that the proceeding not continue as a representative proceeding. The relevant orders were made by the court on 14 April 2022 and reasons published on 22 April 2022.

Friends of Leadbeaters Possum Inc v VicForests (No 3),"In a hearing held on May 2, 2018, Friends of Leadbeaters Possum sought to restrain VicForests from conducting forestry operations in light of the effects of logging on Greater Glider Species through an interim injunction. The Greater Glider was listed as a threatened species under the EPBC Act on May 5, 2016. The Court defined forestry operations under s 40(2) of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Court noted there was evidence of cumulative effects of clearing and logging activities, current burning regimes, and climate change impacts being major threats to large hollow-bearing trees. These trees at issue were relied upon by the species.

In a decision issued on June 12, 2015, the Tribunal upheld the decision, finding that while climate change is occurring, it would not have a significant impact on this particular region or property.

The hydrology study categorized land into categories based on the flood planning level. This study considered the impacts of climate change on the flood planning.

The objections to the permit included consideration of environmental impact and landscape impacts, among others. The sole reason a planning permit was needed for the building was because its height exceeded seven meters from ground level.
    In an order issued on December 16, 2015, the Court granted the permit to develop the land, finding the development plan to be acceptable.

Greenpeace v. Spain I,"On September 15, 2020, Greenpeace Spain, Oxfam Intermon, and Ecologistas en Accion filed a motion notifying the Supreme Court of their intention to sue the Spanish Government, alleging failure to take adequate action on climate change. The plaintiffs assert that Spain is in violation of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. According to plaintiffs, by December 2019, Spain should have approved a National Energy and Climate Plan with climate goals for 2030 and a Long Term Strategy with goals for 2050; and the draft plan is not consistent with the Paris Agreement and IPCC recommendations to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The complaint seeks an order compelling greater climate action. 

On September 30, 2020, the Supreme Court admitted the statement of claim and required the Ministry of the Presidency to present its administrative file within 20 days. After the government presented its file, plaintiffs filed an application for the Court to order an expanded file on the argument that the file the government presented was incomplete. The Court rejected this application, and Plaintiffs appealed. 

In the meantime, on November 3, 2020, Spain's Council of Ministers approved a Long Term Decarbonization Strategy for 2050. Then, on November 26, 2020, the State Attorney filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims with regard to the Long Term Strategy, and plaintiffs filed a motion on December 15, 2020 agreeing with the dismissal of that claim but retaining their suit challenging the lack of a 2030 plan. 

On December 15, 2020, plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the Supreme Court, alleging that Spain unlawfully failed to produce a National Energy and Climate Plan with 2030 climate targets, in violation of national law, EU regulations, and their obligations under the Paris Agreement. 

The government filed their response on March 2, 2021. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court issued a decision rejecting all of the plaintiffs' witnesses as irrelevant to the trial, and the plaintiffs appealed this decision.

Also in March 2021, the government approved the National Energy and Climate Plan. The defendants then filed a brief requesting dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs filed their response on May 26, 2021. In the meantime, the plaintiffs filed additional case challenging the National Energy and Climate Plan. 

On June 14, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court found that the approval of the National Energy and Climate Plan did not exhaust plaintiffs' claims because their claims were broader than simply seeking the passage of the Plan. Instead, they sought an order that the Plan must be more ambitious to be aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. On June 30, 2021, the government appealed. On July 9, 2021, the plaintiffs responded to the appeal. 

On September 14, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected the State's appeal to dismiss the case. The Supreme Court found that the inactivity of the Spanish government can still be observed, since the government has not fully complied with the content of the Paris Agreement.

On March 7, 2022, the Supreme Court issued a ruling (not publicly available) which stated that the case was ready for deliberation. Greenpeace appealed the ruling based on formal considerations. The appeal particularly focused on a request that Greenpeace vs. Spain II be jointly considered and judged, given the close connection between the matters under both of them. On March 31, 2022, the Supreme Court rejected Greenpeace's arguments and confirmed the earlier ruling. The case is pending final decision.

On 20 June 2023, the Supreme Court issued its final decision on Greenpeace v. Spain, known as the trial for climate (el juicio por el clima). The decision was notified to the parties on 27 July and, although still pending publication, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Government of Spain and against the environmental and human rights organizations such as Greenpeace and Oxfam who sued the Government of Spain alleging failure to take adequate action on climate change. Particularly, the plaintiffs alleged that the National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030  (PNIEC) approved by the Government of Spain was not ambitious enough to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals.  Spains Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 is the main Spanish instrument that defines the goals for GHG emissions reduction, sets out the objectives for renewable energy and those of energy efficiency for the period 2021-2030.

The plaintiffs requested the Supreme Court that the PNIEC was declared partially null, as the objectives laid out not to exceed 1.5o C were not ambitious enough, as the GHG emissions reduction should at least be 55% in 2030, compared to 1990, and the organizations found that the 23% reduction set out in the PNIEC was not adequate. Alternatively, the plaintiffs requested the Supreme Court that the PNIEC was wholly declared null. 

Notwithstanding, the Supreme Court decision argues that the Government of Spain has acted in accordance with the Paris Agreement and cannot be held accountable for non-compliance, as it has joined the Paris Agreement through the European Union, and has passed national legislation in accordance with the commitments adopted at EU level. 

The Supreme Court points out that although the Paris Agreement and the subsequent EU commitments and regulations adopted constitute the minimum limit for Member States to adopt their own regulations, it cannot be concluded that the Spanish Government has failed to adopt regulation, when the regulation passed is aligned with the EU commitments to which the Spanish State is adhered such as the Paris Agreement. 

Moreover, the Supreme Court argues that the objectives laid down in the PNIEC cannot be deemed as arbitrarily, but on the contrary, as they are aligned with the EU regulations and follow EU's criteria for PNIECs. The Court goes beyond to state that, in declaring the PNIEC null, and even noting that the Paris Agreement and EU regulations allow Member States to set out more ambitious objectives, if the Court declared the PNIEC null it could be in violation of the scope of their jurisdiction, as the PNIEC was adopted and negotiated harmoniously within the EU.

Lark v. Shellharbour City Council,"In February 2012, Shellharbour City Council granted an application to demolish a garage and construct a new dwelling in flood prone land, subject to certain conditions, including meeting minimum floor height requirements. Those floor height requirements were set, in part, to take into account projected flood zone changes due to climate change. On September 4, 2015, Mitchell Lark appealed a denial of his application to modify those conditions to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court. Lark sought to modify the conditions to allow for an as-built floor height slightly below the minimum  requirement, on the argument that the built floor could be protected by the addition of masonry edging to the front and side porches and rear deck. 

On December 18, 2015, the Court rejected Larks appeal and affirmed the City Councils conditions. The Court reasoned that the site was on flood prone land in a Medium Flood Risk Precinct, and that the Council would likely not have approved the development application had the floor levels as-built been proposed. Further, the Court found that the applicants expert witness did not take into account climate change-related sea level rise.

Shrestha v. Office of the Prime Minister et al.,"On August 23, 2017 Padam Bahadur Shrestha filed an application to compel the government of Nepal to enact a new climate change law. When the authorities failed to respond, Shrestha petitioned the Supreme Court of Nepal to issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate order to enact such a law. According to the petition, the Environmental Protection Act of 1997 was inadequate because it did not address climate change, the Climate Change Policy of 2011 had not been implemented, and as a result, the humans and ecosystems of Nepal had experienced grave climate impacts. Shrestha alleged that the governments failure to adequately address climate had violated the rights to a dignified life and a healthy environment guaranteed in the Constitution of Nepal, and violated Nepals commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The existential threat created by climate change impaired his constitutional rights to (i) live with dignity, (ii) live in a healthy and clean environment, (iii) access basic healthcare services, and (iv) food and protection from starvation. The petitioner further argued that a specific climate change law was needed as the Environment Protection Act made no provision for climate change mitigation and adaptation. He contended that the gap must be rectified immediately. 

In a decision issued on December 25, 2018, the Supreme Court found that action was needed to ensure climate justice, sustainable development, and intragenerational and intergenerational justice. Nepals commitments under multilateral climate change treaties and the operation of the 2015 constitution required action. Article 51(g) of the Constitution of Nepal obligated the government to protect the environment. The court concluded that climate change impaired the petitioners constitutional right to a dignified life and a clean and healthy environment. 
The Court ordered the government of Nepal to enact a new climate change law to (i) mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, (ii) reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and promote low carbon technologies, and (iii) develop scientific and legal instruments to compensate those harmed by pollution and environmental degradation, among other provisions. The Court issued a writ of mandamus and ordered the government to pass and implement a new climate law to effectuate Nepals commitments under the Paris Agreement and obligations under the Constitution. The Court further reasoned that the Environmental Protection Act of 1997 was inadequate to address needed climate change mitigation and adaptation, and ordered the government to implement existing national climate policy until the new law would be enacted. Further, pending passage of the climate change law, the court directed the government to implement its climate change policy, National Adaptation Programme of Action 2010, and National Framework on Local Adaptation Plans for Action 2011.

Subsequent to the Supreme Court decision, the government of Nepal passed the Environment Protection Act of 2019 and the Forests Act of 2019. Both are linked below.

Korean Biomass Plaintiffs v. South Korea,"On September 28, 2020, more than 60 solar power plant owners and residents near biomass plants sued the South Korean government in the South Korean Constitutional Court, challenging biomass subsidies on climate and pollution grounds. The plaintiffs allege that the South Korean New and Renewable Energy Promotion Act and regulations treat biomass generation as renewable and low or zero carbon, thus making it eligible for significant subsidies. According to the plaintiffs, however, biomass generation leads to forest devastation, higher CO2 emissions than coal, and local air pollution. As a result, South Korea's biomass policy violates South Korean constitutional environmental rights.

The plaintiffs also allege that Korean biomass policy infringes on the property rights of solar power plant owners and other renewable energy developers. They argue that the false classification of biomass burning as carbon neutral and renewable diverts subsidies away from other, truly carbon neutral resources.

Greenpeace Mexico v. Ministry of Energy and Others (on the Energy Sector Program),"On August 20, 2020, Greenpeace Mexico filed a complaint in the District Court in Mexico City against Mexico's new Energy Sector Program for 2020-2024. The Program was finalized on July 8, 2020. The complaint alleges that the Program violates human rights -- including the right to a healthy environment and right of access to electricity based on renewable sources -- by promoting fossil fuel use at the expense of investments in renewable energy, greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and adaptation. 

On September 21, 2020, the Court stayed issued a preliminary injunction temporarily suspending the program pending resolution of the case. The Court suspended the program, in part, because it prioritized fossil fuels in a way that could constitute imminent danger that is difficult to repair. 

On February 22, 2021, Greenpeace expanded its complaint against the Federal Expenditure Budget for the Federation for the fiscal year 2021, annexes 15 and 16. Annex 15 refers to the assigned budget for the energy transition strategy to promote the use of renewable technologies, and Annex 16 refers to the assigned resources for adaptation and mitigation of the climate change effects. On March 19, 2021, the Court denied the request to issue a preliminary injunction suspending the Federal Budget annexes. The request was denied because suspending the of the effects Federal Budget would contravene public order, due to its importance to society.

On March 31, 2023, in relation to the Energy Sector Program for 2020-2024, the Court determined that the lawsuit was filed outside the deadline established by law. Regarding the complaint against the Federal Expenditure Budget for the Federation for the fiscal year 2021, the Judge declared the lawsuit inadmissible because the budget for that year is no longer in effect. Therefore, the case was dismissed.

Thomas v. EPA,"Guyanese scientist Dr. Troy Thomas filed a case against the EPA of Guyana in the  Supreme Court, alleging that the 23-year permits EPA had issued to Esso Exploration (a subsidiary of Exxon) for oil exploration violated regulations under the Environmental Protection Act that limited such permit lengths to five years. EPA had issued permits to Esso that ran through 2040 and 2043. In an affidavit supporting the filing, Thomas argued that issuing such a long permit in violation of law ""exposes Guyana and the rest of the world to serious, if not irreparable, harm and adverse consequences from climate change.""

On October 7, 2020, the Supreme Court of Guyana issued a consent order accepting a settlement between Thomas, EPA, and Esso. EPA agreed to reduce the term to of the permits to five years, so that they would expire in 2022 and 2024. The Court also ordered EPA to pay Thomas' court costs.

PSB et al. v. Brazil (on deforestation and human rights),"On November 11, 2020, seven political parties in Brazil (Partido Socialista Brasileiro (PSB) and six others) brought an action against the federal government for violating fundamental constitutional rights by failing to implement the national deforestation policy, and thereby contributing to dangerous climate change. The political parties, organized by a coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), allege that by failing to implement Brazil's Action Plan for Prevention and Control of the Legal Amazon Deforestation (PPCDAm), the federal government violated the fundamental rights of indigenous peoples and present and future generations. 

The suit demands that the federal government and its bodies implement the PPCDAm and suggests the Court set benchmarks for compliance including: (i) meet an 80% deforestation rate reduction relative to the 1996-2005 average by 2021, (ii) enact a temporary moratorium on all deforestation until 2022 if that rate cannot be reached by 2021, and (iii) increase the power of federal authorities to set penalties for illegal deforestation. 

The coalition of NGOs organized the lawsuit and compiled evidence of the government's suspended enforcement of the PPDCAm. According to the NGOs, Brazil saw a 34% increase in the Amazon deforestation rate between 2018 and 2019. Due to procedural requirements for such an action alleging the violation of a fundamental constitutional right, heard directly at the Federal Supreme Court (STF), the NGOs organized seven political parties to bring the case. 

On November 24, 2020, the STF's Minister Carmem Lucia received the complaint and granted several request from NGOs for admission as amicus curiae. Subsequently, the Attorney General's Office requested the rejection of the claim. On September 20, 2021, the Attorney General argued that an Action for Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF) cannot impose on the Executive Branch how to manage illegal deforestation in the Amazon Forest. In addition, the Attorney General argued that both the Presidency and the Ministry of the Environment are taking the appropriate measures  to preserve the Amazon. As such, the requests are incompatible and must be considered unfounded by the court.

On March 18, 2022, the minister and president of the STF, Luiz Fux, admitted seven environmental cases on the agenda for March 30, 2022 (including two climate cases, this case and <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/psb-et-al-v-brazil/"">ADO59</a>). This move by the STF is considered  historical, and was called the ""green agenda.""

On April 6, 2022, following Supreme Federal Court (STF) minister Carmen Lucia s decision that the Federal Government should resume the PPCDAm (Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon Region) within the framework of ADPF 760, Minister Andre Mendonca requested further information, effectively putting the brakes on the ruling. In addition to determining that the Federal Government should set out a plan to combat deforestation following the guidelines of the PPCDAm (Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon Region) within the next 60 days, the Minister-Rapporteur also took the stance that in the ruling of ADPF 760 and ADO 54, the STF should collaborate in strengthening government organs linked to the social-environmental agenda, like Funai (National Indian Foundation), Ibama (Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) and ICMBio (the Chico Mendes Institute of Conservation of Biodiversity), given the shortcomings that exist at the government level. She went on to acknowledge the situation of unconstitutional aspects regarding illegal deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest and the failure of the Brazilian state concerning the role of protecting an ecologically balanced environment. The minister further stated that the right to an ecologically balanced environment is one of the human rights included in agreements that Brazil has committed to, not only in the Constitution but also in international pacts.",Pending,['Brazil>Federal Supreme Court'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights', 'Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems']","['Brazil>Action Plan for Prevention and Control of the Legal Amazon Deforestation (PPCDAm)', 'Brazil>Constitution of 1988']",Whether Brazil's failure to curb deforestation and resulting climate change violates fundamental constitutional rights of indigenous peoples and current and future generations. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/brazilian-socialist-party-and-others-v-brazil/

Institute of Amazonian Studies v. Brazil,"On October 8, 2020, the Institute of Amazonian Studies (Instituto de Estudos Amazonicos - IEA) filed a Public Civil Action (class action) against the Federal Government of Brazil, seeking recognition of a fundamental right to a stable climate for present and future generations under the Brazilian Constitution, and seeking an order to compel the federal government to comply with national climate law. Plaintiffs allege that the federal government has failed to comply with its own action plans to prevent deforestation and mitigate and adapt to climate change, violating national law and fundamental rights. Plaintiffs assert that the government has failed to meet the Brazilian emissions targets set out in the Climate Change National Policy Act, a binding act passed by the Brazilian legislature. In order to meet these targets, the federal government issued a decree setting out specific action plans for preventing and controlling deforestation in various Brazilian biomes, as well as outlining sectoral plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key part of this decree is the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). By failing to meet critical targets in the PPCDAm and emissions targets, plaintiffs allege that the government is violating fundamental rights and national law. Plaintiffs seek an order to compel the federal government to comply with its existing policies, to reforest an area equivalent to what was deforested beyond the statutory limit, and to allocate sufficient budgetary resources for this purpose.

In July 2021, the Federal District Court of Curitiba issued an order rejecting jurisdiction and transferring the case to the 7th Federal Environmental and Agrarian Court of the Judiciary Section of Amazonas, on account of the alleged connection between this case and another case in that court. The other case involves a dispute over whether the government adequately implemented measures to combat those who put the Amazon forest and its ecological hotspots under threat during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lower court found that both lawsuits aimed at combating illegal deforestation in the Amazon and both referred to the PPCDAm, thus presenting sufficient similarity or close connection between the issues discussed, thereby giving rise to an undue risk of conflicting solutions. IEA appealed the transfer decision to the federal appellate court (TRF4). 

On August 20, 2021, the TRF4 (through a decision from the reporting judge) suspended the lower court decision to transfer the case and returned the case to the Federal District Court of Curitiba. The Court found that this case and the ecological hotspots case ""present quite different typology and structure, specialized instruments and distinct political-legal approaches, in addition to the fact that their object, cause of action and demands do not coincide."" The Court found that this case has as its central objective to put pressure on the legislative and executive branches to ensure a stable climate. The ecological hotspots case, on the other hand, addresses matters related to environmental law, and does not have a central theme linked to Brazilian climate legislation. The decision also includes a lengthy discussion of the unique nature and importance of climate litigation. On December 7, 2021, the third chamber of the appellate court confirmed the decision. 

On March 29, 2022, the TRF4 issued a decision delimiting the powers of the amicus curiae, given their inability to appeal the decisions of the process. The judge considered the request for the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to act as amicus curiae in the case to be unfounded, given that the entity did not show interest. Furthermore, the decision called for a conciliation hearing and judgment of the case to be scheduled within 30 days and for the parties, the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Public Ministry to be summoned regarding the date and time of the hearing. It is worth mentioning that the order also deals with the possibility of the parties being accompanied by technicians in order to clarify any points on the subject. Two days after the dispatch of the order, the parties were summoned and the hearing was scheduled for May 18, 2022 in the courtroom of the 11th Federal Court.",Pending,"['Brazil>Curitiba>Federal District Court of Curitiba', 'Brazil>Federal Regional Court, 4th Region']","['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment', 'Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems']","['Brazil>Action Plan for Prevention and Control of the Legal Amazon Deforestation (PPCDAm)', 'Brazil>National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)', 'Brazil>Constitution of 1988']",Whether the Brazilian Constitution guarantees a fundamental right to a stable climate and whether the Brazilian government may be compelled to meet emission and deforestation reduction goals,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/institute-of-amazonian-studies-v-brazil/
"Elliott-Smith v. Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy et al.","In December 2020, Georgia Elliott-Smith, a waste industry expert and environmental consultant, won permission to challenge two aspects of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS), which will replace the EU Emissions Trading Scheme in January 2021. Elliott-Smith alleges that the total emissions cap is too high to meet short and medium-term obligations under the Paris Agreement, and that the emissions cap unlawfully omits municipal waste incinerator emissions. She further alleges that the Climate Change Act of 2008 sets the purpose of the UK ETS as reducing emissions, whereas the government set the emissions cap for the improper purpose of easing the UK's exit from the EU. 

The plaintiff's challenge was dismissed in July 2021. However, in dismissing the case the court noted that its acceptance of the government's arguments did not require any denial of the ""the urgency of the need to address climate change and involves the recognition that in order to meet the long term requirements of the Paris Agreement action is required now.

Transport Action Network v. Secretary of State for Transport and Highway England Company (on Roads Investment Strategy),"On June 1, 2020, Transport Action Network (TAN) filed a suit in the High Court of Justice challenging the legality of the UK government's Second Roads Investment Strategy, covering the years 2020-2025, on climate and air pollution grounds. TAN, an environmental advocacy NGO, named the Secretary of State for Transport as the defendant and Highways England Company, appointed by the Secretary to implement the strategy, as an interested party. TAN listed four grounds for its suit: 1) the Secretary failed to take into account the impact of the roads strategy on achieving climate objectives, in violation of the Infrastructure Act of 2015 and the objectives of the Paris Agreement; 2) the Secretary unlawfully failed to establish a metric for measuring GHG emissions; 3) the Secretary unlawfully failed to ensure levels of air pollutants do not exceed limits set in air quality regulations; and 4) the Secretary unlawfully failed to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the roads strategy. 

On July 21, 2020, the High Court admitted the case on the first ground - that the Secretary unlawfully failed to take into account climate impacts. On October 19, 2020, TAN renewed its application for the court to admit the air pollution claims, and a hearing was held on the issue on October 29, 2020. 

On July 26, 2021, the High Court dismissed the case. The Court found that the Secretary of State for Transport, in approving the strategy, had given adequate regard to UK Policy on Climate Change. The Court upheld the Department of Transport's determination that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the RIS were de minimis and not obviously material to the decision-making process. In the course of the judgment the Court also observed that ""there is nothing in the IA 2015 [Infrastructure Act 2015] which remotely resembles environmental decision-making.""",Decided,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects']","['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'United Kingdom>Infrastructure Act 2015', 'United Kingdom>Climate Change Act 2008']",Whether the UK government's Second Roads Investment Strategy unlawfully fails to consider climate and air pollution impacts,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/transport-action-network-v-secretary-of-state-for-transport-and-highway-england-company/
Transport Action Network v. Secretary of State for Transport (on National Policy Statement),"In 2020, a series of three linked legal challenges were brought by environmental NGO Transport Action Network (TAN) related to UK's road building policies. TAN argued the UK government acted unlawfully by not suspending and reviewing its National Policy Statement on National Networks, given what TAN claimed were significant changes in climate law and policy since the policys designation in 2014. The policy statement sets the strategy for the UKs road building programme. The government has powers to suspend and review policy statements under the Planning Act 2008, and must take into account certain criteria when doing so.

TAN began with a series of pre-action letters, available on its website. They included requests to the government to suspend and review the policy statement in light of, amongst other matters, the new statutory target of net zero UK emissions by 2050. In October 2020, the government decided a review was not appropriate. This resulted in TANs first claim for judicial review (CO/4575/2020). That claim was then stayed as the government had stated that it would reconsider whether a review was appropriate. 

In February 2021, the government decided, for a second time, a review was not appropriate. This resulted in TANs second claim for judicial review, issued in April 2021 (CO/1482/2021). However, that claim became theoretical when the government made a fresh decision, in July 2021, to conduct a review, partly because of the increased stringency of climate change targets and policy. 

Nonetheless, the government declined to exercise its statutory power to suspend the policy statement pending its review.
This resulted in TANs third claim for judicial review, issued in September 2021 (CO/3011/2021), specifically challenging the decision not to suspend the policy statement. The High Court refused permission for that claim to proceed to a full hearing (firstly on the papers, and then following a permission hearing), bringing the legal challenges to an end.",Decided,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects']",['United Kingdom>Climate Change Act 2008'],"Whether the UK government's national policy statement on road building must be suspended and reviewed in light of new, more ambitious climate targets",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/transport-action-network-v-secretary-of-state-for-transport-on-national-policy-statement/
KEPCO Bylong Australia v. Independent Planning Commission and Bylong Valley Protection Alliance,"On September 18, 2019, the Independent Planning Commission of New South Wales rejected KEPCO Bylong Australia's application to build the Bylong Valley coal mine on several grounds, including its contribution to climate change. The Commission's grounds of refusal included the failure to develop a plan to manage the Scope 3 greenhouse gas emissions associated with the project and the fact that ""the distribution of costs and benefits over and beyond the life of the mine [was] temporally inequitable in that the economic benefits accrue to the current generation and the environmental, agricultural and heritage costs are borne by future generations.""

KEPCO, a major Korean utility company, appealed the decision in the New South Wales Land and Environment Court on December 16, 2019. After the Commission declined to participate in the proceedings, the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance, a community group, successfully intervened and was joined as a second respondent.

On December 18, 2020, the Court rejected KEPCO's appeal, upholding the Independent Planning Commission's findings that the mine was contrary to the principles of ecologically sustainable development and would have problematic climate impacts.

On March 19, 2021, KEPCO subsequently submitted another appeal to the NSW Court of Appeal. On August 25, 2021, the Court dismissed the appeal. The Court found that the Commission had adequately found that KEPCO had not proposed to minimize GHG emissions and that the State Climate Change Policy concerning GHG emissions was applicable. 

On October 14, 2021, KEPCO applied for special leave to appeal the decision to the High Court in a final bid to overturn the refusal. The High Court declined to grant special leave, meaning KEPCO has exhausted all legal avenues to challenge the refusal.

Conservation Council of Western Australia v. Hatton and Woodside,"On December 21, 2020, the Conservation Council of Western Australia (CCWA) filed suit against the former chairman of the Western Australia EPA and the natural gas company Woodside, alleging that the EPA had allowed Woodside to process unlimited amounts of gas at two plants, in violation of the state's Environmental Protection Act. According to news reports, CCWA alleges that the state EPA had previously only allowed the plants to process gas from particular sources. Then, in July 2019, EPA made two decisions allowing the plants to process gas from any source, made under provisions of the Environmental Protection Act that allows minor changes to previous approvals without significant assessment. CCWA alleges that the environmental and climate impacts were major and should have triggered the full consideration of the EPA. According to news reports, Woodside is partnering with Shell, BP, Chevron, and BHP to extract, transport, and process the gas as part of the Burrup Hub project. 


At a three day hearing commencing on December 20, 2021, CCWA told the court that the former chairman of the Western Australia EPA (Hatton) had to engage in his own intellectual process when approving recommendations by the EPA to allow the plants to process gas from any source. The Court rejected this argument, saying that CCWA had not established the chair did not consider the possible environmental and climate impacts and had not proved the chair made an error.

Friends of the Earth v. UK Export Finance,"In September 2020, Friends of the Earth England Wales and Northern Ireland brought a legal challenge against UK Export Finances decision (the Decision) to provide over $1 billion of UK taxpayers money to help finance a liquefied natural gas (LNG) project off the coast of Mozambique. Through the project, the energy company Total (an interested party) aims to extract 43 million tonnes of LNG per year for 32 years. This will result in total combustion emissions of 4.3 billion tonnes of CO2e: more than the total annual emissions for all 27 countries within the EU.

This case is not concerned with whether, or the extent to which, the UK government should have considered the Paris Agreement in reaching its decision. Rather, it is concerned with whether, having concluded that both the project and its financing were compatible with the UK and Mozambiques obligations under the Agreement, and having taken the decision on that basis, the decision was lawful.
In March 2022 the High Court issued a judgment with a split two-judge court. One of the judges ruled: (a) the government erred as it had no rational basis to conclude financing the project was consistent with article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement; (b) government ministers approving the deal were misled; and (c) for finance flows to be aligned to the Paris Agreement, they must be demonstrably aligned with the Agreements temperature goals. The second judge ruled the decision was lawful. He held the court should give the government latitude in deciding for itself what enquiry to make, for example when quantifying climate impacts, and that the court should only scrutinise the governments decision lightly. The claim proceeded to the Court of Appeal.

In January 2023 the Court of Appeal gave judgment, unanimously dismissing Friends of the Earths appeal. The court held:
1) On the standard of review, the government was only required to adopt a tenable view of what the Paris Agreement meant. It was not required to adopt a correct view, as Friends of the Earth had argued (relying on the Vienna Convention).
2) In this case the government had adopted a tenable view.
3) It was not irrational to make the decision to fund such a project without quantifying its scope 3 emissions. The project would have gone ahead with or without finance from UK Export Finance, the absolute quantification of scope 3 emissions would not have answered the nuanced question of whether the financing was compatible with the UKs obligations under the PA, and the obligations in question were not absolute requirements to restrict the increase in global average temperature and to make finance flows consistent with a low-emissions pathway and climate-resilient development, but rather, these were only some of the purposes of the PA.

Though the court declined to construct the PAs precise meaning, it held that:
	The actions required by Articles 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13 are not merely aims and aspirations, as one of the lower judges held, but are to be taken with the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and for purposes including achieving the temperature goals and making finance flows consistent with a low-emissions pathway.
	The temperature goal in article 2(1)(a) is a clear objective of the PA, to which all parties committed.
	It was not clear to what extent the project would contribute to the fossil fuel transition, and it was not necessary for the respondents to take any firm view as to the precise nature of the UKs obligations under the PA, only as to what was not required of the UK, namely that article 2(1)(c) does not create an obligation for the UK to show that its decision on overseas funding is consistent with a low-emissions pathway. Because the respondents were advised that the project could, in some scenarios, align with the UKs obligations under the PA, the decision was not irrational.

In June 2023 the Supreme Court refused Friends of the Earth permission to appeal the Court of Appeals decision, bringing the litigation to an end.",Decided,"['United Kingdom>England and Wales>Court of Appeal>Court of Appeal (Civil Division)', 'United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice']",['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement'],Whether the UK government's decision - that its financing of a liquified natural gas project in Mozambique aligned with its climate commitments - breached public law duties.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/friends-of-the-earth-v-uk-export-finance/
Greenpeace Netherlands v. State of the Netherlands,"On October 7, 2020, Greenpeace Netherlands filed suit alleging that the Dutch government's bailout package for airline KLM violated the State's duty of care to prevent the high risk of dangerous climate change. In a notice of possible legal procedure sent to the Dutch government in advance of the suit, plaintiffs cited the European Convention on Human Rights and the Paris Agreement as establishing that duty of care, and the Dutch Supreme Court's Urgenda decision as affirming the duty of care. Plaintiffs alleged that by failing to attach binding climate conditions to the 3.4 billion euro bailout package, the government violated human rights. Greenpeace sought a court order either prohibiting the State from providing financial support or conditioning such support on KLM setting a cap on CO2 emissions by the airline.  

On December 9, 2020, the Hague District Court judge rejected Greenpeace's claim on the grounds that the State does not have a legally enforceable obligation to attach climate conditions to the bailout package. The judge reasoned that the executive has a high level of discretion in acting to respond to the coronavirus crisis, and that a judge is limited in such situations to intervening only where a positive legal right has been violated. The judge found no such right here because the Paris Agreement and other international climate treaties do not commit parties to reducing emissions from cross-border aviation. Further, the judge noted that the sustainability conditions that were included in the bailout package were fully in line with the Netherlands' international climate obligations.

ClientEarth v. European Investment Bank,"On April 12, 2018, the European Investment Bank (EIB) agreed to provide a 60 million euro loan to build a 50 megawatt biomass power plant in Spain. Environmental NGO ClientEarth submitted a request on August 9, 2018, to the EIB for internal review of that decision. ClientEarth disputed that the project would contribute to renewable energy objectives because, in part, it overestimated environmental advantages associated with biomass and underestimated logging and forest fire emission risks. On October 30, 2018, EIB rejected the request as inadmissible on the grounds that its financing decision was not an ""administrative act"" nor was the decision taken ""under environmental law"" as defined in the Aarhus Convention and therefore was not subject to internal review.

ClientEearth filed suit on January 8, 2019, in the EU General Court against the European Investment Bank (EIB), alleging that the bank had improperly rejected ClientEarth's petition for an internal review of the Bank's decision to finance a biomass power plant. ClientEarth argued that in rejecting its petition for internal review, the EIB misapplied the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.

The EU General Court issued a decision on January 27, 2021, issuing an order that the EIB must accept ClientEarth's petition for internal review. The Court found that the financing decision was taken ""under environmental law"" because all acts of public authorities which may violate environmental law, regardless of whether the institution is formed by environmental law, should be subject to internal review. Here the EIB's decision was based on an assessment of whether it met renewable energy goals and therefore impacted environmental law. Further, the Court found that the decision was an ""administrative act"" despite the terms and conditions of the loan not yet being set because it produced definitive legally binding effects on third parties by enabling others to take steps to formalize the loan.

On April 2, 2021, the EIB appealed the decision with the European Court of Justice. The EIB alleges that the General Court, under the Aarhus Convention, misconstrued the notion of an administrative act, that the EIB decision to approve the loan does not have legally binding and external effect, and that the General Court was wrong when it classified the EIBs decision as adopted under environmental law.

Greenpeace East Asia and others v. Ministry of Economic Affairs,"On February 3, 2021, Greenpeace East Asia, the Environmental Jurists Association, and four individual plaintiffs filed suit against Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA), alleging that the agency's Regulation for Large Power Consumers was not ambitious enough, in violation of the country's climate laws. MOEA's Regulation for Large Power Consumers entered into force on January 1, 2020 and requires large consumers to transition 10% of their contracted capacity to renewable energy. Plaintiffs challenge two aspects of the regulations. They argue that the regulations improperly applied only to 10% of contracted capacity, rather than 20% of actual consumption; and the regulations improperly raised the threshold for who qualifies as a large power consumer to 5,000kWh, exempting 90% of large company consumers. Plaintiffs argue that the defects are in violation of the Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act and the Renewable Energy Development Act, which set a 20% renewable energy goal by 2025. Plaintiffs seek a court order for the MOEA to amend the Regulation for Large Power Consumers. According to the plaintiffs, this is the first citizen suit in Taiwan seeking a reduction in carbon emissions.

Segovia et al. v. Climate Change Commission,"In 2017, petitioners sued the Government of the Philippines seeking to reduce air pollution from vehicular emissions. They argued that the governments failure to address air pollution was prejudicing life, health, and the property of all Filipinos. Petitioners alleged that the government should reduce personal and official consumption of fossil fuels by at least 50%. They asserted that the government should (i) reduce vehicular traffic by implementing road sharing with pedestrians and cyclists, (ii) devote public open spaces to sustainable urban farming, and (iii) allocate more budget to mitigating environmental pollution. The petitioners had sought the writs of kalikasan (protection of constitutional rights to a healthy environment) and continuing mandamus to compel the Presidentially-created Climate Change Commission to implement a variety of measures to promote biking and walking and disincentivize car travel. Petitioners based their claims in the Philippine Constitution and Executive Order 774, which designates a task group to reform the transportation sector and follow the principle ""those who have less in wheels must have more in road."" 

However, on March 7, 2017 the Supreme Court of the Philippines dismissed the lawsuit for failing to establish the requisites for the issuance of the writs. The Court found that petitioners had not established that the Commission was guilty of violation or neglect of environmental laws as required by the writ of kalikasan. Further, petitioners failed to prove direct or personal injury arising from the government's failure to act, as required by the writ of continuing mandamus.

Hanuman Laxman Aroskar v. Union of India,"On March 29, 2019, the Supreme Court of India suspended the environmental clearance for an airport in the State of Goa and ordered the government to revisit the clearance. Petitioners, citizen Hanuman Laxman Aroskar and NGO Federation of Rainbow Warriors challenged the clearance in the Supreme Court. The Court suspended the airport's environmental clearance on the grounds that the government failed to take into account impacts on the environment that were crucial to the environmental assessment process. The Court reasoned that ""[f]undamental to the outcome of this case is a quest for environmental governance within a rule of law paradigm."" The Court then cited both the Paris Agreement and India's Nationally Determined Contribution to the Paris Agreement as key aspects of India's environmental rule of law and as reasons that the government was required to adequately balance environmental concerns with airport development goals. 

On January 16, 2020, after additional submissions by the airport project proponents, the Supreme Court lifted its suspension of the environmental clearance, allowing the airport project to go forward. The government took notice of the addition environmental impact information provided, including a commitment to make the airport a ""zero carbon airport operation,"" and imposed addition environmental conditions on the project. The Court reasoned that the government had adequately addressed concerns outlined in its 2019 decision.

Greenpeace Mexico v. Ministry of Energy and Others (on the National Electric System policies),"On May 25, 2020, Greenpeace Mexico filed a lawsuit against the Mexican government contesting the constitutionality of two electricity sector policies that would limit renewables. Greenpeace Mexico asked the Administrative Court to declare the policies unconstitutional for violating the rights to a healthy environment and sustainable development and for obstructing Mexico's compliance with its international commitments to tackle climate change. The two policies challenged were the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) Agreement ""to ensure the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity and safety of the National Electric System, on the occasion of the COVID-19 epidemic"" and the Ministry of Energy policy of ""Reliability, Security, Continuity and Quality in the National Electrical System."" The former ordered the suspension of certain wind and photovoltaic power plants in operation or on the approval stage prior to commercial operation. The latter supported the CENACE Agreement's suspension of renewable energy power plant operation and the promotion of oil-based power generation. Greenpeace filed the case in the Mexico City's Second District Administrative Court Specialized in Economic Competition, Broadcasting, and Telecommunications.

On June 23, 2020, the district court issued a preliminary injunction to suspend the effects of the contested acts. On November 17, 2020, the district court held its main hearing. The Court then issued its judgment that the public policies were unlawfully modifying the rules of the energy market, and were violating the right to a healthy environment of Mexicans. The government appealed the decision to the First Circuit Collegiate Tribunal.

The Court decided the contested acts were unconstitutional. First, authorities were not competent to issue the policies. Furthermore, the policies violate the human right to a healthy environment, as well as (i) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (ii) the Kyoto Protocol, and (iii) the Paris Agreement (all ratified by Mexico), by imposing a policy that displaces renewable energies, which prevents Mexico from meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions targets to which it committed. The Court considered that the production and consumption of fossil fuels affect the environment to a greater extent, due to the amount of GHG and compounds they produce. The implementation of its provisions undoubtedly implies a risk of damage to the right to a healthy environment, since it encourages the operation of conventional power plants that generate a greater amount of emissions that pollute the environment. The risk of environmental damage is projected in both dimensions (individual and collective), since, on the one hand, it can affect individual health of people and, on the other hand, it does not contribute to mitigate the effects of climate change, which impacts on the universal interest owed to present and future generations to preserve and protect natural resources. Finally, the policies also imply the implementation of regressive measures in relation to the right to a healthy environment, because instead of contributing to increase the goals of minimum participation of clean energies in the generation of electric energy, they reduce or inhibit their progress. The principles upon which the judge based his decision are: (i) in dubio pro natura, (ii) civic participation, (iii) non-regression principle and, (iv) the inclusion of future generations in the notion of progress (any unjustified and significant decrease in the level of environmental protection achieved will affect the heritage to be passed on to the next generation).",Decided,"['Mexico>First Circuit Collegiate Tribunal', 'Mexico>District Court in Administrative Matters']",['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment'],"['Mexico>Electricity Industry Law', 'Mexico>General Law on Climate Change', 'Mexico>Constitution']",Whether National Electric System policies are unconstitutional for discriminating against renewables. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-mexico-v-ministry-of-energy-and-others-on-the-national-electric-system-policies/
Global Legal Action on Climate Change v. The Philippines Government,"A group called Global Legal Action on Climate Change (GLACC) filed a petition against various government departments including the Climate Change Commission, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Interior, and Local Government with the Supreme Court of the Philippines seeking relief from dangers arising from flooding, which is expected to become worse and more consequential to Filipinos as climate change intensifies. Specifically, GLACC sought a writ of mandamus from the court that would order government agencies to act on the provisions of two statutes pertaining to flood control: Republic Act 6716 the Rainwater Collector and Springs Development Law requires each Filipino locality to have and maintain a rainwater collector to ensure fresh drinking water is available in times of flooding; Act 7160 or the Local Code of 1991, which establishes the responsibilities of local governments in relation to water management. The suit builds on the writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court in 2009, which established both a Filipino right to environmental protection and a channel for seeking relief from infractions of that right. The petition alleges that noncompliance with the two statutes is rife and increasingly harmful as the Philippines the world's most typhoon-prone nation experiences more frequent and severe storms and flooding.

A cement company owner challenged the Notification on the grounds that it violated their constitutional right to freedom of trade, business, and profession under Article 18 of the Constitution, and that the government acted in undue haste by issuing the regulation without full consideration of scientific impacts. The Supreme Court rejected the challenges and upheld as proper the government's consideration, based on a consultant report, that new or expanded cement plans could cause further depletion of groundwater and other harmful environmental impacts. As part of its consideration, the Court emphasized the need to for the government to uphold the precautionary principle in protecting the rights to life, sustainability, and dignity of communities surrounding the project areas. In addition, the Court recognized the need to protect the right of nature itself, writing, ""[m]an and his environment each need to compromise for the better of both and this peaceful co-existence requires that the law treats environmental objects as holders of legal rights.""

Mullner v. Austria,"After having exhausted all national remedies available, with the final decision from the Austrian Supreme Court communicated to the parties on October 12, 2020, on March 25, 2021, an Austrian citizen with a temperature-dependent form of multiple sclerosis (MS) filed a case against the Austrian government for violations of his human rights for failing to set effective climate measures to reduce GHG emission and ultimately contrast the effect of climate change. In the filing, the petitioner alleges facts, including that most MS patients suffer from Uhthoffs syndrome, which is a temperature-dependent sensitivity. The sensitivity causes patients like the petitioner to lose more muscular control as temperatures go up. 

The petitioner alleges that through inaction on the climate crisis, the Austrian government has violated his constitutional right to family and private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and has allowed foreseeable risks to his right to life under Article 8 and 13 of the ECHR. The petitioner also alleges that he has no effective remedy available in the Austrian legal system, which is a violation of his rights under Article 13 of the ECHR. This is because Austrian law does not provide an opportunity to challenge administrative omissions and legislative inaction on the climate crisis, and no administrative body or court is obliged to hear his claims on the merits. Despite the above, the petitioner did try all national court remedies before the Constitutional Court, but the case was dismissed.

Six Youths v. Minister of Environment and Others,"This is a Popular Action, with a request for an injunction, filed by young activists who are members of the Engajamundo and Fridays for Future Brasil movements, against Ricardo de Aquino Salles (in his capacity as Minister of the Environment), Ernesto Henrique Fraga Araujo (former Minister of State for Foreign Affairs) and the Federal Union. 

Youths claimed that the 2020 submission of its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) was less ambitious than the previous one, presented in 2015, in breach of the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). The 2020 Brazilian NDC would allow the country to reach the year 2030 emitting between 200 million and 400 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) more than proposed in 2015. Youths claimed that the reduction of Brazil's climate ambition through the use of accounting artifice constitutes ""climate pedaling"" and requested an injunction until the effects of the new NDC were determined and it was updated in accordance with the progressiveness required by the Paris Agreement. Youth asked that: (i) the 2020 NDC be declared null; (ii) the defendants present an NDC with the percentages of reduction of CO2e emissions increased beyond the necessary limit, aiming at the fulfillment of the commitment of progressiveness of the Paris Agreement; and (iii) condemning the defendants to pay damages for their actions. 

A monocratic decision was handed down from the Federal Civil Court of Sao Paulo that recognized the competence of the Court, since the Paris Agreement was signed and promulgated internally, but rejected the injunction, as it was not possible, summarily, to state that the new NDC did not reflect the greatest possible ambition. After the decision, the defendants filed a contestation, alleging preliminarily the absence of domestic jurisdiction to analyze the matter on the grounds that: (i) acts of sovereignty practiced at the international level are not subject to internal control by the ordinary civil jurisdiction and bind States in terms of foreign relations; (ii) no connecting elements between the subjection of the matter to national jurisdiction were presented; (iii) the Paris Agreement provided for its own dispute settlement mechanism; and (iv) there was no harmful act, as Brazil continues to play a leading role in mitigating the effects of climate change with the greatest possible ambition, in addition to the update being in line with the international best practices.",Pending,['Brazil>Sao Paulo>14th Federal Civil Court of Sao Paulo'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],"['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Brazil>National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)']",Whether Brazil's updated NDC violated the Paris Agreement and Brazil's constitution by decreasing its ambition.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/six-youths-v-minister-of-environment-and-others/
Envol Vert et al. v. Casino,"On March 2, 2021, an international coalition of eleven NGOs sued the French supermarket chain Casino for its involvement in the cattle industry in Brazil and Colombia, which plaintiffs allege cause environmental and human rights harms. The alleged environmental harms include destruction of carbon sinks essential for the regulation of climate change resulting from cattle industry-caused deforestation. The plaintiffs seek to compel the Casino group to comply with its obligations under the French duty of vigilance law of March 27, 2017.

The plaintiffs argue that in spite of Conduct Adjustment Terms signed with Brazilian slaughterhouses to comply with the Brazilian law according to which ""all agents in the production chain are responsible for environmental damage caused with their consent"", Grupo Pao de Acucar, Casino's Brazilian subsidiary, is still being supplied by cattle from deforested areas or from farms established on indigenous territories. Grupo Exito, Casino's Colombian subsidiary, also made commitments to eliminate practices inducing deforestation. The plaintiffs allege that the yearly vigilance plans released by Casino since 2018 lack substance and/or applicability.

On September 21, 2020, the eleven claimants put Casino on formal notice to respect its obligations by adopting appropriate measures to prevent the risks of serious attacks on human rights, fundamental freedoms, human health and safety, and the environment. On December 17, 2020, the Casino Group responded claiming that 1) the group's vigilance plan would include an updated risk map, an assessment of suppliers, and actions to prevent and mitigate risks, and a system for monitoring measures and evaluating their effectiveness, 2) the law on the duty of vigilance only establishes an obligation on companies to take reasonable actions to comply, and 3) the measures requested would be unreasonable.

The plaintiffs demand that the Saint-Etienne Judicial Court order Casino to 1) establish, implement and publish a detailed compliant vigilance plan identifying risks caused by the activities of the group, and 2) on the basis of a lack of vigilance, under Article L. 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code, to compensate Brazilian Indigenous groups for the loss of opportunity and moral damage stemming from Casino's failure to adhere to its duty of vigilance.",Pending,['France>Saint-Etienne Judicial Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']","['France>French Commercial Code>Article L. 225-102-5', 'France>Duty of Vigilance Law']",Whether the French supermarket chain Casino violated the French duty of vigilance law through its involvement in cattle-industry caused deforestation in Brazil and Colombia. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/envol-vert-et-al-v-casino/
Klimaticka zaloba CR v. Czech Republic,"On April 21, 2021, a group of Czech citizens filed suit against the government of the Czech Republic for its inaction on climate change and the human rights harms this inaction is causing. Plaintiffs include climate action NGO Klimaticka zaloba CR, a municipality (Svaty Jan pod Skalou), and four individuals, and defendants named are the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture ,the Ministry of Transport, and the Government of the Czech Republic. Plaintiffs allege that the government, by failing to adequately address climate change, is violating Czech citizens' rights to life, health, environment, and others that are guaranteed by the Czech constitution, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. Plaintiffs plan to present evidence that country has a limited carbon budget in order to meet its constitutional and Paris Agreement obligations, and that the government's Climate Protection Policy allows for emissions 2.5 times higher than the carbon budget allows. Plaintiffs seek a court order for the government to take necessary measures to maintain a carbon budget of 800 Mt CO2 from January 2021 until the end of the century, and to take necessary measures to adapt to climate change. 

On June 15, 2022, the Prague Municipal Court upheld the lawsuit and ordered the state to urgently take the necessary measures to slow climate change. The Court ruled that the states failure to take sufficient GHG mitigation measures is unlawful and that the state should abstain from continuing to infringe the plaintiffs rights by such failure. The court derived the obligation to mitigate climate change from the Paris Agreement and the EU Climate Law (which sets the target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990), as the Czech Republic does not have a climate act yet. State authorities are obliged to have a plan of precise and complete measures to achieve this goal, which is not yet set in place. While the Court concluded that the goals of the Paris Agreement (of keeping the increase in global temperatures below 2oC) is not legally binding, the national contribution of the Czech Republic cannot be avoided. Avoiding these climate goals would threaten the plaintiff's constitutionally guaranteed rights. The government cannot absolve itself of its climate responsibility by noting its small contribution to climate change. 

The defendants (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Transport) will have to adopt additional measures to reach the 55 % reduction in GHG by 2030 as the measures set out in the Climate Protection Policy of the Czech Republic are not sufficient to achieve the emission reduction target set by the EU. In particular, the state will have to take necessary steps to reduce GHG in the fields of energy, transport, and forestry within six months. However, the adaptation claims made by the plaintiffs were dismissed as the state prepared a new adaptation plan and is actively implementing some measures. 

The Ministry of the Environment appealed on points of law to the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic. On February 20, 2023, the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic overturned the decision of the Prague Municipal Court and referred the case back to the first instance court (the Prague Municipal Court). The main reason for the reversal of the first instance decision is the collective character of the EUs obligation to reduce its GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 and the fact that the specific distribution of the obligations to Member States is currently still subject to legislative and political negotiations. The Supreme Administrative Court also stated that plaintiffs should further specify in which specific areas the defendants alleged passivity breached their obligations, which specifically interfere with the applicants rights.

Plan B Earth and Others v. Prime Minister,"On May 1, 2021, Plan B Earth (an environmental charity) and Adetola Stephanie Kezia Onamade, Jerry  Noel Amokawandoh, Marina Xochitl Tricks (three young British citizens), and Timothy John Edward Crosland (together the Claimants) filed a petition for judicial review alleging that the UK government violated human rights by failing to implement effective measures to uphold its Paris Agreement commitments. The claimants argue that the Government has failed to produce a coherent plan for addressing the climate emergency. Plaintiffs allege that while the UK government has pledged itself to net zero emissions by 2050, it has undercut this commitment by supporting coal and aviation, granting oil and gas leases, investing more than 25 billion pounds in roads, and financing fossil fuel projects overseas. According to the petition, these policies expose claimants to gross violations of their rights to life, private and family life, and protection from discrimination guaranteed by Articles 2, 8 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as implemented into UK law by the Human Rights Act 1998. Claimants seek a court order that the UK government must urgently implement a legislative and administrative framework sufficient to uphold its Paris Agreement commitments.

The case was refused permission to proceed on the papers, and went to a renewal hearing (for permission) on November 25, 2021 in the High Court. The court handed down its judgment on 21 December 2021, and permission was refused again.

ClientEarth v. Belgian National Bank,"On April 13, 2021, ClientEarth filed suit against the Belgian National Bank for failing to meet environmental, climate, and human rights requirements when purchasing bonds from fossil fuel and other greenhouse-gas intensive companies. The Belgian National Bank has participated in the European Central Bank's Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP), in which six national central banks purchase bonds from eligible companies to improve financing conditions by lowering debt costs. ClientEarth alleges that over half of bonds purchased under the CSPP were issued by greenhouse-gas intensive sectors and that the program, therefore, exacerbates the climate crisis. ClientEarth alleges that the Belgian National Bank's participation in the CSPP, by not taking into account climate, environment, and human rights impacts, violated Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (both concern the obligation to integrate environmental protection into EU policies). As part of its case, ClientEarth sought a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice to determine whether the decision to establish the CSPP was lawful; it argues that it was not because of the failure to take into account climate considerations in designing the CSPP as required by EU law, because the CSPP is itself inconsistent with EU climate policy, and become it undermines the European Union's emissions reduction targets.

In December 2021, the Brussels Tribunal of First Instance rejected ClientEarth's application on procedural grounds in a judgment against which ClientEarth launched an appeal in early 2022. While the appeal procedure was pending, ClientEarth announced that it would withdraw its case ""after the European Central Bank (ECB) accepted its legal obligations to consider the climate in quantitative easing reforms,"" which remedies the violations ClientEarth had alleged on the part of the Belgian National Bank.",Withdrawn,['Belgium>Brussels>Court of First Instance'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Disclosures']","['European Union>Primary Law>Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union>Article 11', 'European Union>Primary Law>Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU']",Whether the Belgian National Bank's purchasing of bonds from fossil fuel companies violated EU law.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clientearth-v-belgian-national-bank/
Attorney General v. Crosland,"On May 10, 2021, Tim Crosland, unregistered barrister and director of the legal charity Plan B, was convicted of criminal contempt of court by a three judge panel of the UK Supreme Court. He was ordered to pay a fine of 5000 as well as the costs of the Office of the Attorney General of the UK.

The Attorney General's office made the decision to prosecute Crosland for criminal contempt of court following Crosland's widely publicized decision to breach a Supreme Court embargo and reveal the outcome of the judgment in the case of Plan B v. Secretary of State for Transport twenty four hours before it was due to be handed down by the Court. Crosland was given advance access to the judgment through a procedure which allows the parties in a Supreme Court case to comment on any errors of fact or law in Supreme Court judgments. Crosland argued that there was an error of fact regarding the Secretary of State's assessment of the potential impacts of a new third runway at Heathrow. Not only had the Secretary of State made the decision with reference to an outdated 2 degree warming scenario rather than the 1.5 degree scenario adopted as the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement, but, according to Crosland's submission, the Secretary had subsequently misled parliament and the public about doing so.

Crosland raised concerns with the Court prior to making the decision to break the embargo in protest of the Plan B v. Secretary of State for Transport judgment. He argued that the Court's unsatisfactory response left him with no option but to breach the embargo in order to publicize and protest the Secretary of State's wrongdoing. During the contempt proceedings, he argued that the disclosure should not be treated as contempt because his decision was a necessary and proportionate response in light of the climate crisis and the huge loss of life that would be incurred by exceeding the 1.5 degree temperature limit. 

At an appeal hearing on October 18, 2021, Tim Crosland argued that the Supreme Court judges had disregarded his justifications to proceed to the leak, put in doubt their independence and impartiality, and qualified the fine as ""arbitrary and unjust."" The Attorney General contended that the European Convention on Human Rights' article 10 did not encompass the right ""to be listened or heeded,"" and that Crosland could not jurisdictionally appeal from and to the Supreme Court. His appeal was heard by the only five supreme court justices who were not involved in either the original contempt hearing or the Heathrow ruling.

On December 20, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected Crosland's appeal and concluded he could have expressed his views after the judgment was made public. The justices noted that they saw no persuasive evidence that Crosland would not have been able to get his message across if he had complied with the embargo and refrained from discussing the outcome of the Heathrow appeal and his criticisms of the judgment until after it had been handed down. In a separate ruling, Lady Arden highlighted that Croslands conduct was aggravated by the fact that he is a qualified barrister and therefore would have been particularly aware of the seriousness of not complying with the courts directions.

He owes duties to the court.",Decided,['United Kingdom>Supreme Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Protesters']",['United Kingdom>Criminal Code'],Whether a barrister who breached a Supreme Court embargo by publishing the outcome of a case 24 hours early should be held in criminal contempt of court.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/attorney-general-v-crosland/

Westmoreland v. Canada,"In November 2018 the Mining Company Westmoreland Coal Company submitted a notice of arbitration and statement of claim under Chapter 11 of the North American Free Trade Agreement. In it, the company argued that it was unlawfully excluded from a scheme developed to compensate investors for losses associated with the Alberta government's Climate Leadership Plan, which accelerated the deadline for the phase out of coal power to 2030. 

The company argued that, as the only US investor in Alberta's coal industry, it was excluded from the compensation scheme while Canadian companies were able to benefit from it. This was a violation of Article 1102 and Article 1105 of NAFTA, which guarantee investors domiciled in member states national treatment and guarantee fair and equitable dealings. The company acknowledged the Government's need to ""enact regulations for the public good"" but argued that they must also behave fairly to foreign investors. 

In January 2022 the arbitral tribunal dismissed the claim. Following the initial filing of the claim by the Westmoreland Coal Company, control of the relevant assets had changed hands during bankruptcy proceedings, and the purchaser, Westmoreland Mining Holdings LLC had sought to continue the claim. The arbitrators concluded that the new entity no longer entitled to pursue the claim, with no substantial discussion of the substantive merits in the matter.

Ministerio Publico Federal v. de Rezende,"On April 16, 2021, a Federal Environmental and Agrarian Court in Brazil issued a preliminary decision granting an injunction against a Brazilian farmer (Dauro Parreiras de Rezende), ordering the removal of a cattle herd from farms that caused deforestation.

The MPF further seeks up to R$ 85.4 million (about USD $17 million) in monetary damages from de Rezende for (i) residual material and intermediate climate damage, i.e., the value of emissions that deforestation has caused; (ii) collective pain and suffering as a violation of human rights (moral damages); (iii) intermediate and residual material environmental damages; and (iv) compensation for illegal profits from deforestation.",Pending,['Brazil>Amazonas>7th Federal Environmental and Agrarian Court of the Judiciary Section of Amazonas'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Others']",['Brazil>Constitution of 1988'],Whether a Brazilian farmer is responsible for climate and environmental damages stemming from deforestation in the Amazon.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ministerio-publico-federal-v-de-rezende/
"R (oao Cox &amp; Others) v Oil and Gas Authority &amp; Others (""Paid to Pollute case"")","On May 12, 2021, three climate activists, Jeremy Cox, Mikaela Loach and Karin Van Sweeden (the Claimants)  brought a legal challenge in relation to the adoption of the Governments new Oil and Gas Strategy (the Strategy). Their claim was defended by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) and the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (SoS; Kwasi Kwarteng). The strategy was laid before Parliament in December 2020, came into force in February 2021, and gives the OGA a dual mandate to both secure that the maximum value of economically recoverable petroleum is recovered from the strata beneath relevant UK waters and, in doing so, to take appropriate steps to assist the Secretary of State in meeting the net zero target. The strategy sets out plans to support ongoing efforts to exploit North Sea oil and gas reserves. Under the Petroleum Act 1998, the Strategy needs to ensure the maximization of the economic recovery of UK petroleum.""

On January 18, 2022 the High Court gave judgment, rejecting the Claimants two grounds of challenge and dismissing their claim.
The first of the two grounds alleged error of law and/or frustration of statutory purpose. The Claimants argued that by ignoring the effect of government-backed financial support, the Strategy has stretched the definition of ""economically recoverable"" too wide, such that activities that are not truly ""economic"" for the UK are nonetheless still sought to be maximized through the Strategy. According to the claimants, this endangers the UKs ability to meet Net Zero, as required under the Climate Change Act 2008. The main issue was therefore whether the OGA's definition of ""economically recoverable"" in its Strategy was consistent with the statutory term ""maximizing the economic recovery of UK petroleum or whether it frustrates the statutory purpose.


The High Court began its consideration of this ground by considering the courts role, concluding that the court will afford considerable deference to the OGAs expert view as regulator, and that Parliament, when enacting the legislation, did not intend for the court (rather than the expert regulator) to determine the best method of economic assessment. In any event the High Court agreed with the OGAs interpretation of the legislative provisions. (Judgment, paragraphs 55 to 114.)

The second ground alleged the OGAs approach was irrational given the UK Governments net zero target under the Climate Change Act 2008 and statements made by the OGA in relation to that target. The High Court rejected the Claimants arguments. The OGAs approach to the legislation was permissible, as per the Courts findings under ground one. The question of how to balance various objectives is a matter for the regulator, not the court. The OGA, in consulting on and adopting the Strategy, manifestly had considerable regard to UK domestic action on climate change. The Claimants arguments had no basis in the statute and [contradicted] the whole concept of maximizing economic recovery.

Bennett v. Cumbria County Council,"On December 11, 2019, the claimant filed an application for judicial review of Cumbria County Council's decision to grant planning permission for the development of a new underground metallurgical coal mine and associated development in Whitehaven, Cumbria. The claimants argued that the Council had failed to correctly apply the test for new coal projects set out in the National Planning Policy Framework. The challenge to the legality of the decision was based on the following grounds: the defendants failed to properly consider the GHG emissions from the mine and provide adequate reasons for their decision; the defendants failed to properly account for the impacts of ""middlings coal"" in the decision; the defendant failed to give lawful reasons for the imposition of a 15% restriction on the production of middlings coal; the defendant failed to consider the UK Government's Net Zero Target; and the defendant failed to comply with the relevant planning regulations.

A Sud et al. v. Italy,"On June 5, 2021, environmental justice NGO A Sud and more than 200 plaintiffs filed suit alleging that the Italian government, by failing to take actions necessary to meet Paris Agreement temperature targets, is violating fundamental rights, including the right to a stable and safe climate. The action, part of a campaign called Giudizio Universale (The Last Judgment), seeks a declaration that the government's inaction is contributing to the climate emergency and a court order to reduce emissions 92% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. According to an executive summary of the claim released by the plaintiffs, the government's climate obligations stem from the Paris Agreement, EU regulations, and IPCC reports. The human right to a stable and safe climate is based on guarantees in Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union (guarantee of fundamental rights), and Articles 2 (right to life) and 8 (right to privacy) of the European Convention on Human Rights, among others. These rights violations give rise to non-contractual liability of the Italian government under Article 2043 of the Italian Civil Code. 

On December 14, 2021, the first hearing was held before the Civil Court of Rome in the form of written notes. In its reply, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, represented by the Avvocatura Generale dello Stato (state lawyers), requested the Court to declare the complaint inadmissible and, in any case, to dismiss the applicants claims on the merits. On the matter of fact, the reply describes in depth the States policies and endeavors on climate change. On the matter of law, the reply deals with: (i) the absence of jurisdiction of the civil judge over activities pertaining to the legislative and executive powers of the State; (ii) the lack of standing rights of the applicants; (iii) the impossibility of placing an individual responsibility on the Italian State for climate change and its impact. 


The applicants sent their rebuttal notes on January 14, 2022. The second hearing (the first oral hearing) has been held on 21 June 2022. The parties presented their legal arguments before the judge.

Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Incorporated v. The Climate Change Commission,"New Zealands Climate Change Response Act 2002 (as amended 2019) sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050, and creates a Climate Change Commission (CC Commission) to provide periodic advice to the government in meeting that goal. On July 1, 2021, a group of hundreds of New Zealand lawyers sued the country's Climate Change Commission and the Minister for Climate Change arguing that several pieces of advice provided by the CC Commission had violated New Zealand administrative law.  

First, the Commission provided advice that New Zealands NDC was not consistent with the global target of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. LCANZ challenged that advice as being based on a faulty methodology which amounted to an error of logic (para. 81). Specifically, LCANZ argued that the CC Commissions gross-net measure  whereby net emissions in the target year were compared with gross emissions in the base year  was impermissibly inconsistent with the IPCCs approach of comparing net emissions in the target year with net emissions in the base year (a net-net measure). The Commission defended this approach on the basis that New Zealands forestry sector has been a net sink, rather than a source, of emissions  this meant that unlike many other countries, New Zealands land use net emissions were lower than its gross emissions. Although LCANZ agreed with the CC Commission that the 2016 NDC was inconsistent with measure to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees, the accounting method adopted meant that the gap was understated; and that as a result, if the government were to follow the Commissions advice, there would be a net increase in greenhouse gas emissions for the 2010-2030 period. Accordingly, LCANZ argued that the Commission had violated its statutory duty. Secondly, LCANZ argued that the Commission had erred in its advice that it prepared for the government concerning New Zealands emissions budget  that is, a maximum level of emissions that can be released in specific interim periods so as to enable the 2050 goal to be ultimately reached. LCANZ argued that the Commission had impermissibly focused only on the 2050 goal, rather than 1.5 degree limit; and further, that the Commission had pursued economically affordable budgets rather than the statutory requirement that budgets be ambitious but likely to be technically and economically affordable. Thirdly, LCANZ challenged the Commissions use of modified activity-based accounting (MAB) in recommending progress towards budgets and targets. Among other things, this approach averaged out New Zealand forestry stocks and emissions. LCANZ argued that this violated a statutory obligation to use an accounting method aligned with that used by the UNFCCC, and that this violation portrayed a false sense of ambition (para. 9). Finally, LCANZ argued that the Commissions budget advice was irrational, unreasonable and inconsistent with the legislative purpose of contributing to the global 1.5 degrees effort, because it would ultimately allow for emissions to increase over the 2010-2030 period. This ground dealt more with the consequences of the foregoing alleged errors, rather than a specific breach of a statutory duty.

On November 3, 2021, the applicants filed an amended statement of claim, to also challenge New Zealand's updated first nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement to the extent that it relies on the Commission's NDC advice. The applicants seek relief including orders that the Commission re-consider the first three emissions budgets and their advice relating to the 2030 NDC, and that the Minister re-consider the updated NDC.

The hearing took place from 28 February to 3 March 2022. On November 23, 2022, the High Court rejected all four claims. First, it found that it departed from IPCC modeling techniques and that this had the potential to mislead (para. 115), this departure was permissible because the Commission did not intend to make a direct mathematical comparison, and instead used the IPCC modeling only as an indirect comparator (para. 11). The Commission was entitled to adopt the gross-net accounting methodology to avoid New Zealand being penalized for its historically high rate of reforestation. The Court found that the Minister was aware of the potential to be misled, and had understood that the emissions cuts recommended by the Commission were not necessarily in line with the IPCC global pathway. Instead, it represented a value judgment that New Zealand should not be disadvantaged relative to other wealthy countries because of its historical its forestry position. 
Secondly, the Court found that the Commission had correctly understood its role as being to provide budgeting advice on achieving both the 2050 net-zero target, while keeping in mind a broad commitment to contributing to the global 1.5 degree effort. Importantly, the Court found that the 1.5 degree target  which was included only in the purposive section of the domestic legislation  was an aspiration rather than an obligation for the purposes of domestic law (para. 162). The Commission was required only to consider statutory factors related to the 2050 net-zero target, while keeping the 1.5 degree target in mind. The Commissions budget advice had satisfied these obligations. Thirdly, the Court found that the Commission was entitled to recommend the MAB accounting method, as the legislation did not mandate the use of any particular accounting methodology. Instead, it found that the Climate Change Response Act permitted the Commission to advise the Minister to decide on the methodology by which progress against our emission budgets are to be measured (para. 272). Finally, the Court found that the Commissions advice was not ultimately irrational or unreasonable, and instead reflected New Zealands particular circumstances as a developed country, but with significant commercial forestry with cyclical swings (para. 11). Even though the Commissions advice would fail to reduce net emissions by 2030, the legislation did not require emissions reductions by that date, and instead was only required to meet the net-zero 2050 target. It was open to Parliament to decide to make less of a contribution to that [net-zero] goal up to 2030 ... but a contribution that was better than the IPCC global pathways in a short time thereafter (para. 307).

First, ACCR alleges that Santos' claims that natural gas is ""clean fuel"" that provides ""clean energy"" misrepresents the true effect of natural gas on the climate, including the large releases of CO2 and methane during extraction and burning. Second, Santos claims that it has a clear and credible plan to achieve net zero emissions by 2040 are misleading.

Eco Oro Minerals Corp. v. Republic of Colombia,"In 2016, Canadian mining company Eco Oro filed a claim for compensation against Colombia after a series of regulatory measures undertaken by the government to protect the paramo ecosystem. The company alleged that the measures deprived Eco Oro of its mining rights under a 2007 concession contract for the exploration and exploitation of precious metals and associated minerals. The company argued that Colombia breached its obligations under the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) through unlawful and indirect expropriation of its investment and for failing to accord the companys investment the minimum standard of treatment. Eco Oro sought compensation in the amount of USD 696 million. The filing alleged that Colombia breached Article 811 of the FTA relating to expropriation, as well as multiple aspects of Article 805 relating to the customary international law minimum standard of treatment of aliens, including fair and equitable treatment and full protection and security.
 
On September 9, 2021, the tribunal found Colombia to be in breach of the FTA and Eco Oro entitled to damages. The tribunal decided that there was no breach of Article 811 as the regulatory measures protected a legitimate public welfare objective and were adopted in good faith. However, the tribunal found Colombia to be in breach of Article 805 given the governments delay in delimiting the Santurban Paramo and its failure to comply with constitutional obligations to protect the ecosystem at the time of the companys investment. The company had legitimate expectations to undertake the mining exploitation activities in its concession. The tribunal found Colombias conduct to be arbitrary and disproportionate, damaging Eco Oro without serving any apparent purpose.

Instituto Preservar et. al. v. Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. and IBAMA,"In May 2021, four NGOs (AGAPAN, INGA, COONATERRA-BIONATUR and CEPPA) filed a request for precautionary measures against the Brazilian environmental agency, IBAMA, and Copelmi, a mining company, related to an open-pit coal mining project within the Nova Seival coal-fired power plant, which, if approved, will be the largest coal power plant in Brazil. The plaintiffs identified a series of irregularities in the permitting process, including: (i) inadequate public participation, (ii) the lack of analysis of the EIA by the environmental agency, and (iii) the risks and impacts caused by the project. The request was subsequently converted into a public civil action. The plaintiffs sought to suspend a public hearing and the permitting procedure until several material issues with the EIA are resolved. The Ministerio Publico, asked to opine on the case, specifically noted the need to undertake a strategic environmental assessment and asked for the assessment of climate change impacts in the general terms of reference for EIAs related to thermal power stations. 

On August 18, 2020, the Public Prosecutor's Office filed a statement on the case, requesting that: (i) the anticipation of relief claimed by the plaintiffs be granted, with subsequent annulment of the public hearing, (ii) the immediate suspension of the UTE's environmental licensing process Nova Seival until the defects pointed out by IBAMA are remedied, (iii) held at least three public hearings in the cities of Porto Alegre, Hulha Negra or Candiota, (iv) acknowledged the omissions present in the EIA/RIMA and (v) summoned IBAMA for the presentation of a merit analysis study and the EIA/RIMA, prepared by a multidisciplinary team.

On August 31, 2021, the court partially granted the precautionary measures to (i) annul the public hearing previously held, (ii) suspend the permitting procedure of the Nova Seival coal-fired power plant until the irregularities in the EIA are addressed, (iii) hold at least three public hearings, and (iv) include specific requirements in the terms of reference of thermoelectric power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul related to climate change, the need for a strategic environmental evaluation, and potential risks to public health. The requirements to assess potential climate change damages are grounded in the National Policy of Climate Change and the State Law No. 13.594/2010 (state policy on climate change) in the terms of reference of permitting procedures of thermal power stations in the state of Rio Grande do Sul.

Greenpeace v. United Kingdom,"In October 2020, Greenpeace brought a case against the U.K. government for awarding BP Plc a permit to drill for 30 million barrels of oil in the North Sea. Greenpeace is challenging the permit on the grounds that the government allegedly failed (i) its legal duty to assess climate impacts, since it only weighed the effects of emissions from production, and not from the consumption of the oil extracted; (ii) to comply with public consultation requirements; and (iii) to assess how much flaring (the controlled burning of natural gas) would take place as a result of the permit being granted. Greenpeace asked the court to overturn the governments decision to grant BP a permit for the Vorlich oil field. The lack of access to information throughout the permitting process was previously questioned by Greenpeace in another case. 

The original license for the Vorlich field was granted in 1981, when no obligations or legislation existed to regulate climate impacts. In 2018, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) approved the development of BPs 200 million-pound ($275 million) Vorlich project, with the consent of the Secretary of State, which carries out the Environmental Statement process, and granted a final permit to extract 30 million barrels of oil. In 2020, the notice of the Secretary of States agreement to the consent, and the OGAs grant of consent in relation to the Vorlich field were published. BP began extraction from Vorlich in November 2020 and expects to extract 20,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production.

A hearing was held in September 2021. According to news reports, the UK government argued during the hearing that the legal duty to consider indirect impacts of oil drilling on climate change did not extend to the emissions coming from burning oil extracted and that assessing such emissions would be impossible. A decision from a panel of three judges is pending. 

On October 7, 2021 a three judge panel from the Scottish Court of Sessions dismissed the case. The Court confirmed that the matters under consideration, including the issue of consumption emissions, could be considered on the merits by the court despite the previous proceedings. Nonetheless, the Court dismissed the contention that the Secretary of State should have considered the consumption based emissions associated with the project. The Court argued that there was no duty to consider consumption based emissions from the project as part of the environmental impact assessment of the project, arguing that the question of whether the development of new oil and gas projects should cease is a political and not a legal one.",Pending,['United Kingdom>Scotland>Court of Sessions'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],"['United Kingdom>Regulation 16 of the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipelines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999', 'United Kingdom>Climate Change Act 2008']",Whether the drilling permit in the North Sea Vorlich project properly considered climate impacts. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-united-kingdom/
Environment Victoria vs the EPA et. al.,"On September 20, 2021, Environment Victoria launched a legal action against the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) and AGL Energy, EnergyAustralia, and Alinta, owners of Victorias three remaining coal-burning power stations. The plaintiffs question EPAs review of three power station licenses, which lacked more stringent limits on GHG emissions. Environment Victoria argues that the EPA has failed to require best practice management of toxic emissions, take proper account of the environmental principles in the Environment Protection Act and consider key sections of the 2017 Climate Change Act. Environment Australia asks the court to revoke, amend, and attach certain conditions to the licenses. 

In November 2017, the EPA announced the review of Victorias coal power stations. In March 2021, the EPA announced new license conditions for the states three remaining coal power stations. In August 2021, the EPA granted the permits and capped GHG emissions at approximately current levels, instead of lowering the required standards. Victorias Climate Change Act requires the EPA to consider climate change in their review of coal power station licenses, which, according to the plaintiffs, the EPA failed to do. The emissions form the coal-burning power stations represent about 40% of Victorias total emissions. The plaintiffs also question the limits on toxic air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, fine particles (PM2.5) and mercury. 

The trial commenced before Justice James Gorton of the Victorian Supreme Court on October 18, 2022.

Abrahams v. Commonwealth Bank of Australia (2021),"On August 26, 2021, Guy and Kim Abrahams as trustees for the Abrahams Family Trust, shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia, seeking access to internal documents under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The documents relate to the banks reported involvement with several projects including a gas pipeline in the US, a gas project in Queensland, a gas field and an oil field, among other projects that potentially infringe the banks Environmental and Social Framework (E&S Framework) and Environmental and Social Policy (E&S Policy). In particular, the E&S Framework and the E&S Policy require that the bank carries out an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts of the projects and whether the projects are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

On November 4, 2021, the Federal Court of Australia held a hearing to consider proposed consent orders that had been agreed by the parties in previous correspondence. In essence, the proposed consent orders allow the Plaintiffs to inspect a limited scope of the documents sought at the beginning of the proceedings. The plaintiffs legal representative made short oral submissions on the evidence before the Court in order to establish that the plaintiffs were acting in good faith and that inspection was to be made for a proper purpose, as is required by law. CBA made a limited admission to the same effect. On the basis of the limited admission and the evidence before the Court, the Court was satisfied that the plaintiffs met the good faith and proper purpose requirements and made the consent orders.

Vanderstock and Anor vs the State of Victoria,"On September 16, 2021, two electric vehicle drivers, Mr. Christopher Vanderstock and Ms. Kathleen Davis, brought a claim in the High Court of Australia against the State of Victoria to challenge the Zero and Low Emission Vehicle Distance-based Charge Act 2021 (Vic) (ZLEV Act). The ZLEV Act, adopted in July 2021, introduces a new tax that charges electric vehicle drivers between 2 and 2.5 cents for every kilometer they drive. In addition, drivers of electric vehicles are required to submit annual odometer readings to state authorities from which an annual charge is calculated. The plaintiffs argue that the State of Victoria lacks the constitutional authority to impose such a charge based on Section 90 of the Commonwealth Constitution, which, they claim, reserves the exclusive power to levy such charges for the Commonwealth.

While the plaintiffs do not question the act based on a material issue of law that involves climate change, this case is on the leading edge of an issue and is therefore included on an exceptional basis in the database.

Complaint to Ad Standards on HSBCs Great Barrier Reef ad,"On September 16, 2021, a 17-year-old student, Ava Shearer, filed a complaint at Ad Standards, an Australian organization that manages consumer and competitor complaints concerning the countrys self-regulatory advertising codes, against HSBC for a marketing campaign touting its support for protection of the Great Barrier Reef while funding fossil fuel operations. Ms. Shearer claims that HSBCs ads, which claim to be investing in the reefs future and reef credits to support water quality, are contradicted by its financial links to fossil fuel projects that negatively contribute to the climate crisis. Ad Standards assessed the claim against the Environmental Claims Code which covers truthful and factual presentation, genuine benefit to the environment, and substantiation of claims.

Ministerio Publico Federal v. IBAMA,"On April 24, 2020, the Ministerio Publico Federal (MPF) requested a preliminary injunction asking the federal government to immediately promote command-and-control measures to prevent deforestation in at least ten areas with the highest incidence of environmental crimes in the Amazon rainforest. The petition calls for the federal government, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) and the National Indigenous Foundation (Funai) to work together to contain the action of loggers, miners, land grabbers, among other agents in deforestation hotspots through command-and-control measures.

The petition is grounded in scientific data that highlights the significant increase in deforestation in 2020, along with a reduction of federal inspection activity by the environmental agencies. The petition is grounded on the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). The PPCDAm follows Brazils target under the Paris Agreement and the National Policy on Climate Change of reducing deforestation in Amazonia by 80% by 2020, based on the 1996-2005 average. 

The MPF calls on the different government bodies to present an enforcement plan and rapid timeline to implement the necessary mechanisms to contain illegal deforestation. The MPF further requests for the adoption of sanitary barriers and the expulsion of land grabbers in Indigenous lands situated in critical areas of deforestation. The petition also requests that the federal government promote coordination, articulation and cooperation, mobilizing the command-and-control forces of different ministries - Ministry of Justice, Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Environment - to support the exercise of social and environmental police powers necessary for the implementation of an emergency plan. The Union must also make viable the personnel and budgetary resources necessary for the implementation of inspection actions.

On May 21, 2020, the judge in the lower court granted the injunction. The injunction was suspended by the appellate federal court.

Brasilcom et. al. v. Ministerio de Minas e Energia,"On November 18, 2020, the Association of Fuel Distributors (Brasilcom) filed a writ of mandamus with the aim of reducing by 25% the acquisition targets of 14.5 million annual Decarbonization Credits (CBios) for fuel distributors corresponding to the sales of ethanol and biodiesel by mills and distilleries. The writ intended to modify the individual targets for the distributors in the RenovaBio (National Biofuels Policy, Law No. 13.576/2017) program. Renovabio has the goal of contributing to the targets under the Paris Agreement, expanding biofuels in the energy matrix, ensuring the predictability of the fuel market, inducing gains in energy efficiency and reducing GHG emissions in the production, sale and use of biofuels. The annual national decarbonization targets for the fuel sector are RenovaBios main instrument. In 2019, the individual mandatory measures for the distributors of fuel were defined in ANP Resolution No. 791/2019. 

Yet in 2020, the National Counsel of Energy Policy (CNPE) reduced the initial measures due to the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic in the distribution of fuel (CNPE Resolution No. 8/2020). On November 3, 2020, distributors filed a petition to only comply with 50% of current measures, amounting to only 25% of the original targets. The lower court granted the injunction and suspended the terms of the schedule for the acquisition of CBios and accepted the request for a reduction of the targets. On November 16, 2020, the appellate court reversed the decision. On December 5, 2020, the STJ maintained the decision that annulled the injunction.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Bayerische Motoren Werke AG (BMW),"On September 20, 2021, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) filed an action against BMW in the Regional court of Munich for not yet having clearly and irreversibly committed to phase out the sale of passenger cars with internal combustion engines (ICE) by 2030. DUH argues that by failing to do so, the automaker is violating the fundamental right to climate protection and impinging upon the rights and freedoms of future generations, as phase out would be necessary for the company to adhere to its allocated carbon budget. The claim is grounded in the Paris Agreement and German Tort Law. The plaintiff relies on the earlier decision by the Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) on the German Climate Protection Act, where the Court accepted that Germany has a limited total CO2 emissions budget remaining at its disposal (Neubauer v. Germany). The action filed against BMW is one of the first civil proceedings based on this decision.

DUH asks the court to hold that, (i) unless BMW can prove GHG neutrality for Scope 3 CO2 emissions resulting from the intended use of their ICE passenger cars, after October 31, 2030 BMW is obliged to refrain from placing ICE passenger cars on the market; and (ii) unless BMW can prove GHG neutrality for Scope 3 CO2 emissions globally exceeding a total of 604 million tons resulting from the intended use of ICE passenger cars (based on an average mileage of 200,000 km) between January 1, 2022 and October 31, 2030, BMW is obliged to refrain from placing new ICE passenger cars on the market. Alternatively, DUH asks the court to order BMW to stop placing new ICE passenger cars on the German market after October 31, 2030, unless BMW can prove GHG neutrality for the intended use of said cars.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW),"On December 3, 2020, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) brought a claim against the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW), asking the Higher Administrative Court of NRW to order the NRW government to update its climate protection plan. The NRW Climate Protection Act required a climate protection plan to be adopted by 2013 and subsequently updated every five years. NRWs climate protection plan was adopted in 2015, two years after the deadline had passed. The plaintiffs argue that the plan should have been updated in 2018, five years after the 2013 adoption, rather than in 2020. Given that the NRW government has yet to update its plan, the plaintiffs claim the state government is in breach of its Climate Protection Act, and ask the court to order an immediate update of the plan.",Pending,['Germany>North Rhine-Westphalia>Higher Administrative Court of North Rhine-Westphalia'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],"['Germany>Federal Climate Protection Act of 2019 (KSG)', 'Germany>North Rhine-Westphalia Climate Protection Act']",The inadequacy of a climate protection law in the State of Nordrhein-Westfalen. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/deutsche-umwelthilfe-duh-v-nordrhein-westfalen-nrw/
"Jannis Krumann, et al. v. Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW)","On July 15, 2021, the plaintiffs Jannis Krumann, Lea Wynhoff, Tobias Linck, and Mia Hense, supported by environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany), brought a constitutional claim against the state of Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) for the inadequacy of its adopted climate law. The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) to call on the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway, to comply with the remaining CO2 budget and adopt sufficient instruments to achieve and verify the climate protection targets set by the Paris Agreement.

NRW is the German state with the biggest population and the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The 2013 NRW Climate Protection Act was revised on July 1, 2021, increasing the climate protection targets for 2030 (greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 65%), 2040 (greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 88%) and 2045 (achieve carbon neutrality). However, according to the plaintiffs, the interim targets set for the time periods until 2030 and between 2030 and 2040 are insufficient, as they allow emissions to continue to rise in individual emitting sectors. In addition, legal instruments with specific deadlines to track and meet greenhouse gas reduction targets were deleted from the law. In particular, the adopted state law no longer requires the state government to prepare and implement a legally binding climate protection plan to be updated every five years, nor to specify the measures necessary to meet its reduction goals. This obligation was replaced by the introduction of a so-called climate protection audit, which is supposed to accompany the strategies and measures of the state government and to serve as an aid without providing for any binding targets or intermediate goals. 

The plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Courts decision in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, following which Germany adjusted its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argued that codification of a legally binding reduction path is also required at the state level, as states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence. Plaintiffs argued that the NRW law falls short of these constitutional requirements. Plaintiffs asserted a violation by the state of it duty to protect and invoked their constitutional rights, to defend themselves against considerable future restrictions on their freedoms which  in view of rapidly progressing climate change  are to be considered inevitable and are already reflected in the omitted action by the legislature of NRW.

On January 18, 2022, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court did not damit the eleven complaints for adjudication, on the basis of a lack of adequate prospects. Widely in alignment with its decision in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, the Court acknowledged that greenhouse gas reduction burdens cannot be unilaterally offloaded onto the future. However, in the cases at hand, complainants fundamental rights were not violated preemptively, because the state legislatures are not subject to a CO2 emissions budget, which, according to the Court in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, is a prerequisite for such an effect. Rather it is the federal German legislature that is bound by the CO2 budget, but has a prerogative with respect to its implementation.

"Alena Hochstadt, et al. v. State of Hessen","On September 9, 2021, the youth plaintiffs Alena Hochstadt, Dennis Georg, and Lilly Claudi, supported by environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) brought a constitutional claim against the state of Hesse for its failure to adopt a climate protection law. In January 2021, a draft Climate Change Act was introduced to the Hessian state parliament. The bill is currently under review. Plaintiffs argued that the draft did not meet the constitutional obligations for climate protection. On the one hand, because it failed to specify a reliable reduction pathway for complying with the remaining CO2 budget on account of the lack of any annual target-setting. On the other, because it did not prescribe tools and mechanisms for achieving and reviewing the adequacy of the climate protection argues. Further, plaintiffs argued that the 2012 Hessian Energy Future Act was insufficient to fill these gaps, as it only sets a nonbinding target for the expansion of the renewable energy sector and thus also only for one of the sectors relevant for climate protection. Plaintiffs argued that this lack of more stringent targets at the state level violated their fundamental constitutional rights. Further, plaintiffs invoked the states duty to protect their fundamental rights, to request that the state legally stipulate a GHG emissions reduction pathway towards achieving climate neutrality by 2045, to comply with the Federal Climate Protection Act and the overarching 1.5C temperature target, as informed by the Paris Agreement. This case is part of a series of eleven separate constitutional complaints supported by DUH against ten federal states, following the Constitutional Courts Neubauer decision in 2021.

The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) and the Paris Agreement, as transposed in the Federal Climate Protection Act (KSG), to request the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway towards achieving climate neutrality by 2045, necessary to comply with the KSG and the overarching 1.5C temperature target. This case is part of a series of eleven separate constitutional complaints supported by DUH against ten federal states, following the Constitutional Courts Neubauer decision in 2021. 

The law under review, Bavarias 2020 Climate Protection Act (BayKlimaG) aims to: (i) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, to 5 tons per inhabitant per year by 2030; and (ii) achieve climate neutrality by 2050. From 2030 onwards, the state is also required to offset any emissions above the permitted levels. To achieve these goals, the state set up a climate protection program. The plaintiffs claim that the law lacks provisions for setting annual emission levels, specifications on sector-specific targets, deadlines for the climate protection program, and compliance monitoring. Plaintiffs argued that these measures were insufficient to achieve the overall federal targets of the Federal Climate Protection Act.

"Marlene Lemme, et al. v. State of Bayern (subsidiary claim)","On June 30, 2021, youth plaintiffs Marlene Lemme, David Schiepek, Lukas Schulz, Stefan Emmerichs, Julius Papst, Kaspar Sener, Friedl Sener, Andreas Mackler, Clara Goppel-Ramsurn and Lucie Goppel-Ramsurn brought a claim against the state of Bavaria for the inadequacy of its adopted climate law (2020 Climate Protection Act; BayKlimaG). This action is subsidiary to a constitutional claim by the same plaintiffs, to be declared settled provided that the constitutional complaint is upheld. 

The law under review, Bavarias 2020 Climate Protection Act (BayKlimaG) aims to: (i) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% compared to 1990 levels, to 5 tons per inhabitant per year by 2030; and (ii) achieve climate neutrality by 2050. From 2030 onwards, the state is required to offset any emissions above the permitted levels. To achieve these goals, the state set up a climate protection program. The plaintiffs claim that the law lacks provisions for setting annual emission levels, specifications on sector-specific targets, deadlines for the climate protection program, compliance and adaptation monitoring. Plaintiffs argued that these measures are insufficient to achieve the overall federal targets of the Federal Climate Protection Act.

The plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Courts decision in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, following which the German government was ordered to adjust its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argue that ambitious climate protection is also required at the state level to achieve carbon neutrality. Plaintiffs submit that states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence. Plaintiffs argued that the Bavarian law falls short of these constitutional requirements. Plaintiffs asserted a violation by the state of its duty to protect, and invoked their constitutional rights, to defend themselves against considerable future restrictions on their freedoms which  in view of rapidly progressing climate change  are to be considered inevitable and are already reflected in the inadequate action of the legislature of Bavaria.

In light of this, plaintiffs argue that the Bavarian Climate Protection Act needs to be adjusted, as it fails to establish a minimum structure to ensure equal burden-sharing and restrictions on fundamental rights across generations; lacks legally regulated time limits for establishing a climate protection program; and fails to set interim goals for the period until 2030. According to plaintiffs, it also fails to specify yearly emissions limits, sector specific targets, or regulate mechanism for the updating of reduction goals and does not set provisions for readjusting emissions targets. Plaintiffs argue that national climate protection and reduction goals can only be reached if adequate governance structures are in place at the state level. 

On January 18, 2022, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court did not admit the eleven complaints for adjudication, on the basis of a lack of adequate prospects, including the constitutional claim against Bavaria. Widely in alignment with its decision in (Neubauer v. Germany), the Court acknowledged that greenhouse gas reduction burdens cannot be unilaterally offloaded onto the future. However, in the cases at hand, complainants fundamental rights were not violated preemptively, because the state legislatures are not subject to a CO2 emissions budget, which (according to the Court in Neubauer v. Germany) is a prerequisite for such an effect. Rather, it is the federal German legislature that is bound by the CO2 budget, but has a prerogative with respect to its implementation. As regards the federal states, the Court clarified that they too are responsible for climate protection, in particular by virtue of Article 20a of the Basic Law.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Bayern,"On June 24, 2021, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) brought a claim against the state of Bavaria for failing to set up a climate protection program. In its submission, DUH asks the Higher Administrative Court to order the Bavarian government to adopt a new climate protection program, whose measures are suited to: (i) reduce the GHG emissions in Bavaria by at least 55% by 2030; (ii) reduce GHG emissions to less than 5 tons per inhabitant of Bavaria; and (iii) achieve climate neutrality by 2050. 

Claimant argues that this lack of a climate protection program is in violation of Bavarias 2020 Climate Protection Act (BayKlimaG), which explicitly requires the state to establish a climate protection program for the implementation of its reduction goals (albeit not stipulating a detailed timeframe). Claimant relies on the Constitutional Courts findings in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, which recognized the constitutional nature of climate protection (as a means of guaranteeing and protecting fundamental rights), to argue that a new climate protection program has to be set up.

The Planet v. Bolsonaro,"On October 12th, 2021, the NGO All Rise filed a communication to the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court (ICC) requesting an investigation into Brazilian President Jair Messias Bolsonaro for his role in Crimes Against Humanity resulting from ongoing deforestation and related activities in the Amazon rainforest. The communication was filed under Article 15 of the Rome Statute of the ICC, which allows the Prosecutor to make a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize an investigation into crimes within the jurisdiction of the court on the basis of information received from third parties.
 
The communication alleges that President Bolsonaro has promoted and facilitated a widespread attack on the Amazon Biome and those who defend and depend upon it which represents a clear and extant threat to humanity itself. The complaint argues that global climate security is dependent on the Amazon and its key role in regulating global temperatures and weather patterns, and that the severe damage to the functions of the Amazon Biome caused by deforestation, conversion of deforested land to cattle ranching, and vast intentional forest fires has disrupted this critical ecosystem turning it from a carbon sink to a carbon source.
 
The communication argues that through damage and destruction to the rainforest President Bolsonaros administration has inflicted, continues to inflict, and foreseeably risks inflicting profound suffering and loss of life on local, regional and global populations alike. It emphasizes that this is particularly true in the case of local populations living in the Amazon. These local populations are described in the complaint at Environmental Dependents and Defenders. The complaint argues that these populations are the victims of ongoing and intentional persecution by the Brazilian government, conducted in furtherance of a state policy, that amount to crimes against humanity contrary to Article 7 and Article 25(3)c) of the Rome Statute. It argues that since the Brazilian authorities are unable to carry out proceedings against Mr. Bolsonaro and his collaborators, the complaint should be admissible before the ICC under Article 17 of the Rome Statute.

Plaintiffs asked the Regional Court of Kassel to order the company to tighten its carbon emissions target and to cease the extraction of natural gas and crude oil both nationally and internationally, both directly or indirectly (through shareholding or other means of corporate participation), by 2025. 

The plaintiffs argue that the companys (in)actions are causally responsible for interfering with and in violation of plaintiffs rights and freedoms by not adhering to a fair carbon budget. In <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v.

Alongside the Paris Agreement, these findings form the legal basis for the claim by Metz et al. 

On the basis of the companys calculated allocated carbon budget, plaintiffs submit that the company be asked to refrain from: (i) extracting natural gas and/or crude oil that emits more than 0.62 gigatons (Gt) CO2 (natural gas) or more than 0.31 Gt CO2 (crude oil) when burned (calculated as of January 1, 2021), unless the company can demonstrate GHG neutrality for the CO2 emissions in excess of this amount, and; (ii) opening new oil or gas fields, both nationally or internationally, after December 31, 2025; or (indirectly) participating in such openings through equity holdings in other companies.",Pending,['Germany>Regional Court of Kassel (Landgericht Kassel)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']","['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Germany>Federal Climate Protection Act of 2019 (KSG)']",Whether Wintershall Dea AG is violating fundamental rights for not adhering to a fair carbon budget. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/barbara-metz-et-al-v-wintershall-dea-ag/
The City of Cape Town v. National Energy Regulator of South Africa and Minister of Energy,"With the goal of diversifying its electricity consumption with less reliance on the existing sources of energy, the City of Cape Town decided to purchase more renewable energy from independent power producers (IPPs). Despite following the required steps to seek consent from the Minister of Energy to approve the purchase of solar and wind power from an IPP, the Minister failed to respond for over two years. The Minister eventually communicated that all applications were on hold for an indefinite period. 

The city asks the court to issue an order declaring that the Minister of Energys consent is not required for an IPP to establish a new power plant and supply electricity to the City. Alternatively, the City requests an order declaring section 34 of the Electricity Regulations Act 4 of 2006 (ERA) unconstitutional and invalid because it impermissibly imbeds upon the constitutional powers and functions of local government. The City argues that it has a constitutional right to procure energy in the manner it deems best. 

On August 11, 2020, the court postponed the application since it considered the issue an intergovernmental dispute that should be settled outside the court, and referred the dispute back to the parties. The application is postponed indefinitely.

ASA Ruling on Ryanair Ltd t/a Ryanair Ltd,"The Irish-headquartered airline Ryanair ran a series of ads in the United Kingdom on September 2019, boasting of low CO2 emissions and of being the ""lowest emissions airline,"" at 66g CO2 per passenger-kilometers flown. The airline justified this assertion with technological and average load factor arguments. 

On February 5, 2020, the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) concluded the companys claims were misleading, in violation of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing. 

ASA considered the CO2 per passenger distance metric appropriate, and that consumers would understand the relative nature of the claim. However, the ASA also found that consumers would find insufficient information in the ads to substantiate that they would reduce their personal CO2 emissions compared to flying with another carrier. It also put in doubt the data references used by Ryanair, and underlined the fact that well-known competitors were absent from the calculation.",Decided,['United Kingdom>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']","['United Kingdom>UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing']",Whether an advertising on emissions from an airline was misleading. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/asa-ruling-on-ryanair-ltd-t-a-ryanair-ltd/
Mullaley Gas and Pipeline Accord Inc v Santos NSW (Eastern) Pty Ltd,"The Mullaley Gas and Pipeline Accord (MGPA) community action group brought judicial review proceedings challenging the decision of the Independent Planning Commission (IPC) to grant development consent to the Narrabri Gas Project proposed by Santos NSW (Eastern) Pty Ltd (Santos). The Project proposes the development of a new coal seam gas field and associated infrastructure over 95,000ha in Narrabri in north-western New South Wales. The Project will include the construction of up to 850 gas wells and up to 425 well pads over approximately 25 years and gas processing and water treatment facilities.

The approval was based on a State significant development status under section 4.36 of the Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979 (NSW) (EPA Act), because it supports petroleum production. On September 30, 2020, the IPC approved Santos NSWs SSD 6456 application. MGPA argued that the IPC failed to properly assess the impacts of the projects greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. MGPA challenges two aspects of the IPCs rationale: (i) its assessment of the expected GHG emissions advantage compared to coal and (ii) its determination that the downstream GHG emissions (Scope 3) are outside the direct control of Santos and therefore not able to be reasonably conditioned.

The judicial review proceeding filed by MGPA was heard in the NSW Land and Environment Court in August 2021. On October 18, 2021, the court dismissed the legal challenge to the IPC approval of the Narrabri Gas Project. The court found that MGPA had not established that (i) the IPC erred to consider the expected GHG emissions, relevant to section 4.15(1)(b) of the EPA Act, and (ii) since the Scope 3 emissions were inside Santos direct control, the IPCs decision to exclude these conditions was unreasonable. The Court further found that the IPC did not fail to consider the impacts of any potential gas transmission pipeline into consideration in its determination of the development application for the project, relevant to section 4.15(1)(b), because the impacts of any potential gas transmission pipeline were sufficiently remote in the chain of likely consequences as not to be likely impacts of the project.

Lipidos Santiga v. Commission,"This case relates to the European Unions directives on renewable sources of fuel. In 2018, the EU adopted Directive (EU) 2018/2001. The directive relates to the EUs goal of 32% share of renewable energy by 2030. In the transport sector, Member States must require fuel suppliers to supply a minimum of 14% of the energy consumed as renewable energy by 2030. The Regulation (EU) 2019/807 of 13 March 2019 , adopted in 2019, defined, among other things, how to calculate high indirect land-use change-risk (high ILUC-risk) feedstock for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. In the appellants view, the regulation effectively excluded palm oil biofuels from the EU market. 

On August 13, 2019, Lipidos Santiga brought an action questioning the criteria in question. On June 11, 2020, the General Court of the European Union dismissed its action for partial annulment of Regulation 2019/807 on the grounds that the company was not affected by the regulation (T 561/19). On August 24, 2020, Lipidos Santiga appealed. 

On October 21, 2021, the European Court of Justice found that the General Court correctly found that the mere fact that the measure may exercise an influence on an applicants substantive situation is not sufficient ground to consider said applicant as directly concerned by the measure. The Court further found that the General Court was correct in interpreting the provisions not to regulate the importation, processing, or marketing of palm oil intended for the production of biofuels. The provisions are addressed to Member States, not companies, and do not directly entail a prohibition on the use of palm oil or biofuels produced from that material. 

As a result of the adoption of the provisions at issue, Member States will in principle be prohibited, as from 1 January 2031, from including biofuels produced from palm oil for the purposes of the calculation of high ILUC-risk. Additionally, the minimum share concerns only 14% of final consumption of energy in the transport sector. As such, Member States have discretion as to the measures concerning renewable energy, including as regards high ILUC-risk feedstock such as palm oil. The Court found that the General Court correctly held that the practical consequences stem from the implementation of the measures and not from the provisions at issue. The Court therefore dismissed the appeal.

Environmental Justice Australia (EJA) v. Australia,"On October 25, 2021, Environmental Justice Australia (EJA) submitted a complaint to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment, Special Rapporteur on the rights of Indigenous peoples, and Special Rapporteur on the rights of persons with disabilities over the Australian governments inaction on climate change. The complaint was submitted on behalf of five young Australians aged between 14 and 24 years old. It relies on the particular climate vulnerability of young people, First Nations people and people with disabilities, as climate change exacerbates existing inequalities and directly undermines their health and cultural rights.

The complainants rely on the recently recognized right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment by the U.N. Human Rights Council and the Paris Agreements acknowledgment that climate change is a human rights issue. The complainants assert that the Australian government is in breach of the Paris Agreement and multiple United Nations instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. It further relies on the Committee on the Rights of the Childs recent decision in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/sacchi-et-al-v-argentina-et-al/"">Sacchi v. Argentina</a>, noting the particular harms of climate change to children and the governments heightened obligations. The potential rights violations include the right to health, life, family relations, adequate standard of living, education, freedom from any form of violence or exploitation and recreation and play, as well as the right to a healthy environment. The complainants also argue that the material contribution of Australia to climate harms violates the rights of First Nations peoples and disabled people as recognized in international law. 

The complaints ask the Special Rapporteurs to seek explanation from Australia on (i) how the countrys climate inaction is consistent with the human rights obligations, (ii) how the current conduct is compatible with human rights of young Australians and a 1.5oC pathway, and (iii) how the current Nationally Determined Contribution has involved young people in Australia and whether the State will establish a permanent forum to include young people from impacted communities.

"Nature Conservation Council v. New South Wales (NSW) Nature Conservation Council of NSW v Minister for Water, Property and Housing","In October 2021, the Nature Conservation Council (NCC) of New South Wales (NSW) filed a case against the NSW Water Minister and NSW Environment Minister to challenge the validity of the Border Rivers Water Sharing Plan.  The plaintiffs have asked the court to invalidate the Border Rivers Water Sharing Plan in the Murray-Darling Basin on the grounds that decision-makers have failed to properly consider climate change, thereby breaching the Water Management Act 2000.  This includes a failure by the Ministers to factor in the impact of the most recent drought in Australia on the Basin.  The plaintiffs rely on the rights of children and future generations to enjoy and benefit from healthy, functioning river systems.

The plaintiffs allege that rivers in Australia are already being impacted by over extraction.  Climate change will only worsen those impacts and amplify inequities already embedded in water sharing regimes, including for Indigenous Australians and future generations.  The NCC asks the court to look at the impacts beyond the Border Rivers, including surrounding floodplains, downstream rivers and communities, notably the Barwon-Darling/Barka River, since some of its flows come from the Border Rivers catchment.

Pabai Pabai and Guy Paul Kabai v. Commonwealth of Australia,"On October 26, 2021, Wadhuam Paul and Wadhuam Pabai, First Nations leaders from the Gudamalulgal nation of the Torres Strait Islands, filed a case challenging Australias failure to cut emissions and asserting that the governments inaction will force their communities to migrate to new areas. Torres Strait Islander communities face an existential threat due to rising sea levels from climate change. If global temperatures rise more than 1.5oC many of the islands will become uninhabitable. The sea level in the Torres Strait (also known as Zenadth Kes) has risen about six centimeters over the past decade. Without deep emissions cuts, sea levels are projected to rise to a meter or more above present day levels by 2100. The plaintiffs claim that as the ocean rises it will flood and destroy their irreplaceable cultural heritage and sacred sites. This includes burial sites, locations that contain human remains and places that have a spiritual significance.

The plaintiffs present scientific evidence proving that the following climate change-induced impacts already threaten their native title rights and Ailan Kastom, the Torres Strait people's distinctive customary culture: (i) higher temperature, (ii) ocean acidification and higher ocean temperature, (iii) sea-level rise and associated flooding and erosion, (iv) increase in the frequency, size and/or intensity of extreme weather events such as terrestrial and marine heatwaves, severe storms, and flooding, (v) harm and destruction of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and non-human species - coral reefs, and (vi) harm to human health. A continued failure to act will result in the triggering of so-called tipping points making the Torres Strait becoming uninhabitable.

A continued failure to act is likely to result in the triggering of so-called tipping points making the Torres Strait uninhabitable. 

The applicants allege that the Commonwealth owes a duty of care to Torres Strait Islanders to take reasonable steps to protect them, their culture and traditional way of life, and their environment from harms caused by climate change, and that the government has breached this duty as the targets are not consistent with the best available science. Additionally, they argue that the government has breached this duty, including by failing to identify an emissions reduction target and take the as the targets are not consistent with the best available science and implement such measures as are necessary to reduce Australias emissions consistent with that target. Pursuant to the Torres Strait Treaty, Australia is indeed require to take legislative and other action to protect and preserve the marine environment in and in the vicinity of the protected zone, and/or take measures for the prevention and control of pollution or other damage to the marine environment from all sources and activities under its jurisdiction or control.

McGaughey &amp; Davies v. Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited,"The University Superannuation Scheme (the Scheme) is one of the largest private occupational pension schemes in the UK. It provides superannuation benefits for academic and comparable staff in universities and other higher education institutions. The Scheme is administered by its corporate trustee, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (""the Company""), a company limited by guarantee with no shareholders.

The claimant academics are members of the Scheme. Through this common law derivative claim they sought permission to continue proceedings on behalf of the Company against its directors for breach of their directors' duties, alleging the following:

- The Scheme continues to invest in fossil fuels and, despite the Companys stated ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, its directors had no divestment plan, in breach of the directors duties in sections 171 and 172 of the Companies Act 2006.
- Further, or in the alternative, in failing to have a plan, the directors failed to take into account a number of relevant considerations, including the results of a members' ethical survey. The long-term interests of the Company and the Scheme could only be met by ""an immediate plan for disinvestment"" and that the only ""rational action"" that the directors could take pursuant to sections 171 and 172 was ""devise and implement such a plan as soon as possible.""
- The failure to take such steps had prejudiced the success of the Company which had suffered loss in consequence. The directors' breaches ""furthered their own interests"" and the directors ""put their own beliefs with regard to fossil fuels above the interests of the beneficiaries and the Company.""

The claimants sought declarations that the absence of a divestment plan constituted a breach of statutory and fiduciary duties, and that such breaches caused loss to the Company.

In August 2022 the High Court refused the claimants permission to proceed. The Court of Appeal, upholding that decision in July 2023, held:
- This cannot be characterized as a derivative action. There was no prima facie case of loss to the Company as a result of the alleged breaches of directors duties, meaning the claim fell at the first
hurdle.
- Also, it was not alleged the claimants suffered any loss as a result of the alleged breaches. Nor was it suggested the directors were acting in bad faith, or had done other than acted in what they considered to
be the best interests of the Company and the Scheme, having taken proper advice.
- There was no evidence the alleged directors breaches furthered their own interests or that the directors' actions put their own beliefs with regards to fossil fuels above the interests of the beneficiaries and the Company. It was doubtful there was a prima facie case in this regard.
- In effect, this was an attempt to challenge the Companys management and investment decisions as trustee without any ground upon which to do so. There was nothing to suggest the Company has exercised its powers in an improper fashion.
- The claim was well suited to be brought as a direct claim in breach of trust and there was no reason, save perhaps a desire to avoid certain procedural burdens, to seek to bring it in as a derivative action. The derivative procedural mechanism is not intended to enable would be claimants to avoid other procedural hurdles. It is an exceptional remedy when a wrong would otherwise go unremedied. In effect, the claim was a challenge to the Companys investment policy and should have been brought against it as just that.

Laboratorio do Observatorio do Clima v. Minister of Environment and Brazil,"On October 26, 2021, Observatorio do Clima (OC), a network of 71 civil society organizations, filed a class action at the federal court of Amazonas against the Environmental Ministry and Brazilian government. The plaintiffs request that the National Climate Change Policy be updated according to the best available science, the seriousness of the climate emergency, and the latest IPCC report (AR6) to ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by the Brazilian government consistent with a 1.5oC global warming scenario. The plaintiffs assert that climate change affects the constitutionally recognized right to a healthy environment, as well as fundamental rights such as the right to life, dignity, health, food, and housing, along with several recognized principles of international environmental law. The plaintiffs refer to the latest IPCC report to attest to the urgency of the case and the likely damages that will occur in the case of inaction from the Brazilian government. 

Plaintiffs argue that, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Brazil has committed to a series of duties to mitigate climate change. Along with the existing legal climate framework in Brazil (i.e., the Law on Climate Change Policy and the National Climate Change Plan), this entails a duty from the Brazilian government to (i) take the necessary measures to predict, avoid and minimize the identified causes of climate change originating in the national territory; (ii) reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions in relation to their different sources; (iii) make the instruments of the national policy effective; (iv) present successive phases of the national plan; and (v) strive for the maximum possible ambition in reducing GHGs.

Brazil represents one of the worlds largest GHG emitters. Yet, the majority of emissions arise from deforestation rather than from energy sources and transportation. Through the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) published in 2016, Brazil committed to reducing GHG emissions by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030 based on emissions from 2005. On December 2020, the government presented its updated NDC. The new NDC used the same percentage of emissions reductions, but altered the baseline quantity for calculating them, effectively making the second NDC less ambitious than the first. Additionally, Brazil had committed to reducing deforestation by 80% by 2030 in 2015  this provision was deleted from the updated NDC. The plaintiffs assert that the updated NDC effectively violates the Paris Agreement and the national legal framework and the principle of non-regression.

On November 4, 2021, the court scheduled a preliminary conciliatory hearing for November 25, 2021. However, on November 24, 2021, conciliatory hearing was canceled, in view of the Union's manifestation of no interest in the consensual composition of the dispute.

On May 13, 2022, the court rejected the request to combine the case with Six Youths v. Minister of Environment and Others, as requested by the defendants.

Childrens Petition to the United Nations Secretary-General to Declare a Climate Emergency,"On November 10, 2021, 14 youth climate activists from around the world (the same petitioners from <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/sacchi-et-al-v-argentina-et-al/"">Sacchi v. Argentina</a>) submitted a petition to United Nations (U.N.) Secretary-General Antonio Guterres asking him to declare a climate emergency. The petitioners rely on the impacts of climate change on human rights, specifically the rights of children as recognized by the U.N. and its several agencies, including the recent decision of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The petitioners call on the Secretary-General and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to declare a systemwide, Level 3 climate emergency at the U.N. The petitioners further encourage the IASC and the Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) to mobilize a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the Climate Emergency and activate a crisis management team to oversee immediate and comprehensive global action on climate. 

Declaring a Level 3 Emergency, the U.N.s highest designation, would mean placing climate action at the top of the agenda for each U.N. agency. This would ensure that U.N. resources and personnel can be deployed rapidly to dispatch aid and scientific expertise to countries most vulnerable to climate disasters. It would also ensure that the U.N. can help countries meet their emission reduction pledges on an urgent, emergency basis. The petitioners assert that a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the Climate Emergency is necessary (i) as international human rights law requires states to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that have transboundary effects, (ii) to address the fundamental inequities of climate change, and (iii) to provide a legal response to the youth and fulfill the U.N. Charters promise to protect succeeding generations. 

According to the petitioners, the U.N.s response to the COVID-19 pandemic provides the blueprint for climate action. In the face of the pandemic, the Secretary-General and the IASC mobilized a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the global health crisis and activated a U.N. Crisis Management Team. The petitioners argue that the climate emergency warrants a similar response as a threat as serious and urgent as the global pandemic.

Greenpeace v. Instituto Nacional de Ecologia y Cambio Climatico and Others,"On March 9, 2021, Greenpeace filed an amparo, an emergency proceeding, against the National Institute of Ecology and Climate Change, the Inter-secretarial Commission on Climate Change, the Secretariat of Environment and Natural Resources, the Council of Climate Change, and the Mexican President, challenging Mexicos revised Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC). The NGO argued that the NDC failed to respect the principle of non-regression in human rights law. In its original 2015 NDC, Mexico committed to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to 2000 levels. In the revised NDC presented in December 2020, Mexico raised the baseline against which the GHG emission reduction is measured. Greenpeace argued that the updated NDC would effectively cause the additional emission of 14 million tons of CO2e; (ii) eliminate the peak of GHG emissions stipulated for 2026; (iii) rule out the 50% reduction target for 2050, which would nullify the mitigation horizon in the medium and long term. Greenpeace asked the court to suspend the effects of the 2020 NDC. 

On July 14, 2021, the Judge ruled against Greenpeace. On July 30, 2021, Greenpeace appealed the decision. The District Court court failed to notify the Eleventh Collegiate Court of the First Circuit in Administrative Matters, which was deciding the matter of the injunction to suspend the effects of the contested acts. 

On September 21, 2021, the Eleventh Collegiate Court of the First Circuit in Administrative Matters (not knowing of the previous decision) decided to suspend Mexicos 2020 NDC. The court considered Mexicos mitigation commitments to be regressive, in violation of the law. In its place, Mexicos 2015 commitments on mitigation and adaptation for the 2020-2030 period would apply, and the injunction would remain in effect until a superior court ruled on the Judge's decision. 

On December 15, 2022, the Eleventh Collegiate Court of the First Circuit in Administrative Matters heard the plaintiffs appeal. The Collegiate Court ruled against Greenpeace, deciding that the plaintiff did not provide sufficient evidence to prove that the NDC is regressive, nor did it prove that Mexico could emit up to 14 million tons of CO2e more in comparison to the 2015 targets. Therefore, the case was dismissed.",Decided,['Mexico>Eleventh Collegiate Court of the First Circuit in Administrative Matters'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],"['Mexico>General Law on Climate Change', 'Mexico>Constitution']",Whether Mexicos revised NDC violated human rights law for being regressive. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-instituto-nacional-de-ecologia-y-cambio-climatico-and-others/
R (Finch on behalf of the Weald Action Group &amp; Others) v. Surrey County Council (&amp; Others),"The case concerns Surrey County Councils (SCC) 2019 decision to grant planning permission to a company named Horse Hill Developments Limited to expand an existing site to add four new wells for the production of hydrocarbons (crude oil) over a 20 year period. The environmental statement issued by the developer provided an assessment of the direct (scope 1 and 2) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the project but did not assess the emissions that would subsequently be produced as a result of using the product (scope 3 emissions).

The claimant, Sarah Finch, argued that SCCs failure to consider these emissions in determining whether to approve the project was a breach of the UKs obligations under European Union Law (Directive 2011/92/EU, the EIA Directive) as implemented in domestic law by the EIA Regulations. They contended that either SCC had misinterpreted the relevant national regulations in determining that the consumption-based emissions could be excluded from the assessment, or that the relevant regulations were unlawful because they were in conflict with the EIA Directive. They also argued that the consumption emissions from the project should have been considered in relation to the UKs net zero target.

On July 15, 2020, the judge granted permission to apply for judicial review and identified a challenge to national planning policy on the ground that it is not in conformity with EU law. The claim then proceeded in the High Court. On October 20, 2020, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government was joined as an interested party to respond to the new grounds related to national planning policy. Friends of the Earth was granted permission to intervene.

On December 21, 2020, the case was dismissed by the High Court on the basis that the assessment of GHG emissions from the future combustion of refined oil products...was, as a matter of law, incapable of falling within the scope to the EIA required by the 2017 Regulations for the planning application. The case was subsequently appealed. Friends of the Earth was again granted permission to intervene. 

The Court of Appeal hearing took place in November 2021. At the hearing, the Appellant argued: 
	That the High Court had taken an overly narrow interpretation of the EIA regime which was not aligned with established national and EU case law precedent. 
	Furthermore, there was an imbalance between the weight afforded by the decision-maker to the benefits that the use of the extracted oil would bring, and the lack of consideration of the climate impacts of this usage.
	It was advanced that the climate impact resulting from the end-use consumption of the oil extracted must be considered under the EIA regime. 
	Additionally, that the Councils reasons and consequently decision to exclude the end-use emissions from the EIA were inconsistent and legally flawed. 
	The Appellant argued further that it is feasible to measure scope 3 emissions whilst still ensuring that the EIA regime is achievable in practice. 

Friends of the Earth supported the Appellants arguments, and referred to case law on EIA from other jurisdictions, to point to the workability of assessing scope 3 emissions from fossil fuel projects. The Court of Appeals decision was handed down on the February 17, 2022. The decision was split 2:1. The majority ruling was that SCCs decision to grant planning permission without the EIA considering the end-use GHG emissions was lawful. The decision-maker had a discretion on whether or not to include these impacts in the EIA. The dissenting judge, Lord Justice Moylan, concluded that the Councils decision was unlawful. 

This case will be heard by the Supreme Court on 21 June 2023.

Greenpeace France v. France,"On December 7th, 2021, Greenpeace France brought an action before the Paris Administrative Court seeking disclosure of the partnership between the Louvre Museum and the TotalEnergies Foundation as well as the list of members of the Louvre Business Circle. The responsibility of public institutions that accept donations from large oil and gas companies is at stake. 

TotalEnergies has regularly funded exhibitions at the Louvre Museum for more than twenty years. Until 2019, the Louvre Museums activity reports included TotalEnergies in its list of sponsors. In addition, TotalEnergies was one of the founding members of the 2004 Louvre Business Circle, which brings together corporate sponsors. Greenpeace requested copies of the partnership agreements between TotalEnergies and Louvre Museum. According to <a href=""https://www.greenpeace.fr/espace-presse/greenpeace-saisit-la-justice-face-a-lopacite-du-louvre-sur-ses-partenariats-avec-totalenergies/"">Greenpeace</a>, in exchange for these donations, TotalEnergies was able to engage in economic and cultural diplomacy with the countries in which it wished to set up operations or develop business. 

This request comes five months after Greenpeace requested relevant documents from the Louvre Museum and Quai Branly Museum, which are both public institutions under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture. Under French administrative law, any person or legal entity has a right to access administrative documents and may, without having to justify their request, access documents held by the administration within the framework of its public service mission. This right is crucial to understand the decision-making processes and justifications of public policy decisions. While Quai Branly Museum has responded favorably and communicated all the requested partnership agreements signed since January 2015, the Louvre Museum had remained silent. Greenpeace filed a petition for abuse of power against the Louvre Museum for its implicit refusal to disclose administrative documents. 

On January 6, 2022, the French commission on access to administrative documents (Commission d'acces aux documents administratifs) issued a favorable decision for Greenpeace. The Louvre Museum had until February 6, 2022, to send all the requested documents (except the list of projects financed personally by Mr. Pouyanne). Total sent the documents to Greenpeace on January 27, 2022. As a result, Greenpeace France withdrew its claim (which lost its purpose since they obtained the requested documents).",Decided,['France>Administrative Court of Paris'],['Suits against governments>Access to information'],"['France>Public administration code (CRPA)', 'France>Constitution']","Whether the Louvre Museum, a public institution, abused its power by not responding and thus implicitly refusing to disclose administrative documents relating to its partnership agreements with an oil and gas company.

"Africa Climate Alliance et. al., v. Minister of Mineral Resources &amp; Energy et. al. (#CancelCoal case)","On November 10, 2021, three civil society organizations, the African Climate Alliance (ACA), Vukani Environmental Justice Movement in Action (VEM) and groundWork (gW) launched a youth-led constitutional challenge against South Africas Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy and the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA) concerning the governments plans to procure 1500 MW of new coal-fired power electricity capacity (#CancelCoal case). According to plaintiffs, the procurement of 1500 MW of new coal-fired power represents a severe threat to the constitutional rights of the people of South Africa, especially their environmental rights, the best interests of the child, the rights to life, dignity and equality, among others.

The case specifically questions the Ministers determination for 1500 MW of new coal, the concurrence of the NERSA supporting the Ministers determination, and the 2019 Integrated Resource Plan (2019). On September 17, 2021, the organizations sent a letter to the government demanding that it abandon its plan to procure new coal-fired power. The case was brought after the government failed to respond to their demands. The plaintiffs rely on the findings of the IPCC on the urgent need to cut greenhouse gas emissions, as well as a series of in-depth expert analyses of the consequences of new coal-fired power specific to South Africa, including air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution.

The plaintiffs note that South Africa is one of the worlds 15 most significant contributors to GHG emissions, due substantially to the reliance on coal for energy generation, and argue that renewable energy as an alternative to coal represents an environmental and human-health imperative, as well as a viable economic solution to the need to increase the available energy in South Africa. 

NERSA and the Minister of Energy have until 6 and 7 December 2021, respectively, to file the record of all documents and information related to the impugned decisions (known as the Rule 53 record), together with their reasons behind these decisions. The applicants will then have an opportunity to amend and/or supplement their court application. Subsequently, the Minister and NERSA will have to notify the applicants if they intend to oppose the relief sought in the application.

On December 8, 2021, the first respondent, the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, gave notice that he will oppose the application. The plaintiffs have agreed to grant the first respondent an extension to January 20, 2022, to file the record of decision and reasons. After that, the plaintiffs will have an opportunity to supplement their papers. The President has given notice that he will not oppose the case, and will abide by the decision of the court.

Advertising Standards Authority's Ruling on Shell UK Ltd.'s Shell Go+ Campaign,"In January 2020, Shell UK Ltd. launched a radio advertising campaign for its Shell Go+ loyalty scheme. The United Kingdoms Advertising Standards Authority subsequently received 17 complaints challenging claims made in the campaign, arguing that Shells statement that the scheme allowed customers to Drive carbon-neutral was misleading. 

In response to these challenges and the ASAs investigation, Shell stated that its carbon-neutral claim was supported by offsetting carbon emissions from consumer fuel purchases made with a Shell Go+ membership. When a fuel purchase is made by a consumer with a Shell Go+ membership, Shell purchases carbon credits to offset the lifecycle carbon emissions of the fuel purchase.

However, Shell's advertisement did not mention that Shell Go+ was a loyalty scheme. As such, the ASA concluded that the advertisement was misleading, as consumers were likely to infer that Shell Go+ was a new, carbon-neutral fuel rather than a carbon offsetting loyalty scheme, based on the ""drive-carbon neutral"" claims made by Shell in the advertisement. On June 8th 2020, the ASA ruled that the advertisement breached BCAP Code rules on misleading advertising (3.1) and environmental claims (9.2 and 9.3). The ASA stipulated that the advertisement must appear in the complained of form and that Shell UK Ltd must clarify that carbon offsetting is contingent on membership of a loyalty scheme.",Decided,['United Kingdom>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']",[],Whether Shell UKs advertising claim to drive carbon-neutral was misleading to consumers. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/advertising-standards-authoritys-ruling-on-shell-uk-ltds-shell-go-campaign/
SkeenaWild Conservation Trust v. Government of Canada,"On October 27, 2016, the NGO SkeenaWild Conservation Trust filed an application for judicial review of the Canadian Minister for Environment's decision to approve the Pacific Northwest LNG Project. The project consisted of a natural gas liquefaction facility and export terminal on Lelu Island. If built, the claimants alleged that the project would have significant impacts on the salmon population in the Skeena watershed and would be one of Canada's largest single point source emitters of greenhouse gas (GHG). The claimants alleged that the decision to approve the project was based on a flawed environmental impact assessment that failed to adequately consider, among other things, the cumulative environmental impacts of the projects GHG emissions. The claimants relied on the precautionary principle in their submissions, among other issues.

Hauraki Coromandel Climate Action Incorporated v. Thames-Coromandel District Council,"On April 2nd, 2019, the Thames-Coromandel District Council (the Council) decided not to approve the Mayors signature of the Local Leaders Climate Change Declaration (the Declaration). The Declaration is a three page document that declares an urgent need for responsive leadership and a holistic approach to climate change. It calls on the government of New Zealand to prioritize an ambitious transition plan, underpinned by an assessment of the countrys economic vulnerabilities and opportunities. It commits the Council to develop and implement ambitious action plans that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support resilience within communities, as well as work with the central government to deliver on national emissions reduction targets. 

On June 28, 2019, Hauraki Coromandel Climate Action Incorporated (HCCA), an NGO, applied for judicial review of the Councils decision. The Council applied to strike out the claim. On March 20, 2020, Judge Gault issued a judgement that declined to strike out the claim, holding it was arguable the Council decision is amenable to judicial review and the claim is not so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.""

On August 31, 2020, the High Court made a further determination that the claim was justiciable, citing <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/thomson-v-minister-for-climate-change-issues/"">Thomson v Minister for Climate Change Issues</a>, and stating that the existence of a policy dimension to a decision does not immune it from judicial review but rather, the reverse. The Councils decision holds strong public interest. Therefore, given the nature, effects, including potential legal implications, and the decision's significance, it is reviewable by the Court. 

The High Court accepted the expert evidence that anthropogenic climate change is occurring and cited the Supreme Courts decision in the Netherlands (<a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/urgenda-foundation-v-kingdom-of-the-netherlands/"">Urgenda Foundation v. State of the Netherlands</a>) in its finding that ""the inhabitants and environment in the Thames-Coromandel District, and the cost of Council infrastructure, are likely to be significantly impacted by the effects of anthropogenic climate change. 

In establishing whether the Councils decision not to approve signing the Declaration was reasonable, the Claimant asserted that the Court should view the decision along a sliding scale of intensity and that the effects of climate change are such that the intensity of review approaches that which is adopted for human rights. The Claimant further claimed that ""It was unreasonable for the Council to decline to sign the Declaration, given the global consensus on anthropogenic climate change and its predicted effects on the District... Only if a council had taken sound and sensible mitigation steps that went far beyond the Declaration might it be reasonable for them not to sign it. The Mayor was precluded from taking an objective perspective on the matter by her own prejudices.""

The Defendants submitted that the Councils decision was the most reasonable it could make, given the Councils lack of capacity to compel the Mayors signature. It was also reasonable for the Council to decline to make a decision about its future policy on climate change response to Council Peters motion, as the considerations had not been properly analyzed by the Council. Furthermore, while the Declaration may create reviewable expectations, an application based on that ground would be unlikely to succeed because the commitments stated in the Declaration are very general. 

However, the Court accepted the Claimant's argument that the intensity of review of decisions about climate change by public decision-makers is similar to that for fundamental human rights and that heightened scrutiny is deserved in this case. The reasons for the decision indicated the need for further analysis and consideration of the issue. 

As such, the Court has ordered the following remedies: (i) It has declared that the Councils decision was inconsistent with the requirements of the Local Government Act 2002 and the Councils Significance and Engagement Policy; (ii) It has directed the Council to reconsider and determine, consistently with the requirements of the Local Government Act 2002, the Councils Significance and Engagement Policy, and the Courts judgement, whether or not to approve the Mayor signing the Declaration. The Court has awarded costs to HCCA.

Vegetarian Society et al. of Denmark v Danish Crown,"At the end of May 2021, three Danish NGOs filed a suit against Danish Crown, the EUs largest pork producer, claiming that the company is misleading consumers through its campaign that claims its pork production is climate controlled and that the pork is more climate friendly than you would think. Danish Crown is a cooperative owned by over 6,000 Danish farmers. It has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030. 

According to media reports, the claimants allege that Danish Crown is misrepresenting its climate footprint, and is in violation of the Marketing Act, which the Danish Crown refutes. It states that because the pigs have grown up on farms with a clear strategy for reducing CO2 emissions, Danish Crown is not misleading consumers. In its 2020-2021 Annual Report published in November 2021, Danish Crown mentions the lawsuit and that it is cooperating with authorities. 

In January 2022, the court proceedings began in the Western High Court. The court has found that the case is of a principle nature and has a general signification for the application of and development of the law.  The Danish Crown had argued to have the case heard in the Maritime and Commercial Court, which the court has denied. The case will proceed in the High Court.

Italian Competition Authority Ruling Eni's Diesel+ Advertising Campaign,"On December 20th, 2019, the Italian Competition Authority fined Eni, an Italian oil and gas company, five million euros, the maximum monetary penalty, for unfair commercial practices regarding environmental claims. According to media reports, the Authority has determined that green claims contained in advertising messages must: (i) precisely and unambiguously reflect the environmental benefits of the relevant products; (ii) be scientifically verifiable; and (iii) be communicated correctly.

In Enis Diesel+ advertising campaign, a product logo associated the words green"" and Eni Diesel+.  The Authority found this association had induced consumers to attribute the green claims made by Eni in the advertising campaign to the fuel as a whole, when it only applied to a component of the product. As such, media reports state that the Authority ruled that Enis Diesel+ advertising campaign disseminated false and omissive information regarding the fuels environmental impact and greenhouse gas emissions reduction, and constitute an ""unfair commercial practice in violation of articles 21 and 22 of the Italian Consumer Code. 

Eni is planning on appealing the Authoritys ruling before the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio.

"Nuestros Derechos al Futuro y Medio Ambiente Sano et. al., v. Mexico (Unconstitutionality of the reform to the Electric Industry Law)","On March 24, 2021, five civil associations (Nuestros Derechos al Futuro y Medio Ambiente Sano A.C.; Alianza Juvenil por la Sostenibilidad, A.C.; Naj Hub, A.C.; Consejo Interuniversitario Nacional de Estudiantes de Derecho, A.C.; and Agora Ciudadanos Cambiando Mexico, A.C.), with the support of the #JovenesPorNuestroFuturo collective, made up of more than 20 youth groups, filed a lawsuit against the Mexican Congress and the President of Mexico challenging the 2021 amendments of the Electric Industry Law. 

The amendments, in general: (i) eliminate the obligation to dispatch the cheapest energy first and give priority in the process to the Federal Electricity Commissions (CFE) coal and fuel oil-fired power plants, and (ii) eliminate the purchase of basic electricity by the CFE through long-term auctions. Before the amendments, the energy purchased in the auctions and the energy dispatched first was primarily renewable energy.

The plaintiffs argue that the Mexican State is constitutionally obligated to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which necessarily implies designing and implementing an energy policy that favors the gradual substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy. The obligation to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the generation of electricity is based on Article 25 of the Constitution, in connection with the 17th and 18th transitory articles of the Decree of Constitutional Energy Reforms of 2013.

The plaintiffs argue that the challenged amendments violate the constitutional right to a healthy environment found in Article 4. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the transition to renewables in the electricity sector guarantees the exercise of the right to a healthy environment and is a necessary condition for Mexico to comply with its international commitments under the Paris Agreement. In its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), Mexico committed to a 22% reduction of GHG emissions by 2030, and the transition to renewables formed a critical piece of this commitment. The plaintiffs requested the judge to declare the amendments unconstitutional and to force the responsible authorities to comply with their constitutional obligations regarding energy transition and climate change mitigation policies. After the 2013 Constitutional Energy Reform, the Energy Transition Law set generation targets: 25% clean energy generation by 2018, 30% by 2021, and 35% by 2024, with the objective of significant reduction of CO2 emissions to mitigate climate change. 

On April 7, 2021, the District Court issued an injunction to suspend the effects of the contested amendments until the court reaches a final decision on the merits of the case. The judge reasoned that the amendments could undermine the Mexican governments duty to transition towards renewable energy. This duty is mainly established in the 18th Transitory Article of the Decree of Constitutional Energy Reforms of 2013. The judge also noted that, in the Energy Reform of 2013, the legislators agreed that the use of clean energies will enable the Mexican State to work towards its international climate and environmental commitments (specifically, the Paris Agreement and the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals). The Court reasoned that compliance with the international commitments could be hindered by the amendments, because of the limits they place on the generation of clean energies. 

On April 7, 2021, the Mexican government and congress appealed the decision of the District Judge to admit the claim. On April 22, 2021, the Mexican congress appealed the injunction granted by the District Court.

On December 15, 2022, the plaintiffs won in the District Court. The District Court decided that the 2021 amendments to the Electric Industry Law violate the right to a healthy environment and the Paris Agreement by favoring the generation of electricity through fossil fuels. In its decision, the Court recognized four relevant issues: (1) that NGOs have legal standing to file amparo lawsuits (constitutional challenges) to defend the right to a healthy environment; (2) that the Mexican government has a duty to reduce the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity; (3) that the Mexican government has a duty to increase the proportion of clean energy in the electricity sector as part of its obligation to mitigate climate change; and (4) that the challenged amendments have a negative impact on Mexicos clean energy obligations and its international commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

On December 28, 2022, the Mexican government appealed the District Court decision to uphold the plaintiffs claims. The appeal is pending resolution by the appellate Collegiate Court.

"Julia Habana et. al., v. Mexico (Unconstitutionality of the reform to the Electricity Industry Law)","On March 24, 2021, 214 young people aged between 15 and 28 years old filed a lawsuit against the Mexican Congress and the President of Mexico challenging the amendments to the 2021 Electric Industry Law. The amendments, in general: (i) eliminate the obligation to dispatch the cheapest energy first and give priority in the process to the Federal Electricity Commissions (CFE) coal and fuel oil-fired power plants, and (ii) eliminate the purchase of basic electricity by the CFE through long-term auctions. Before the amendments, the energy purchased in the auctions and the energy dispatched first was primarily renewable energy.

Mexico</a>, with youth acting as plaintiffs, rather than civil associations. 

The plaintiffs argue that the Mexican State is constitutionally obligated to mitigate and adapt to climate change, which necessarily implies designing and implementing an energy policy that favors the gradual substitution of fossil fuels for renewable energy. The obligation to transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy in the generation of electricity is based on Article 25 of the Constitution, in connection with the 17th and 18th transitory articles of the Decree of Constitutional Energy Reforms of 2013.

The plaintiffs argue that the challenged amendments violate the constitutional right to a healthy environment found in Article 4.

On March 26, 2021, the District Court in Administrative Matters dismissed the case for a lack of standing. In Mexico, to file an amparo lawsuit (as in this case), the plaintiffs must prove that they have a personal, qualified, current, real, and legally relevant interest, which can be translated, if successful, into a legal benefit in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiffs must prove that they are in a situation that differentiates them from the rest of society, and they must prove that their human rights are being directly affected.

The Court reasoned that the plaintiffs did not meet this standard, because the negative effects that the plaintiffs could suffer as a consequence of the environmental damage do not place them in a special situation or give them a differentiated grievance. In other words, these consequences would be suffered by any Mexican, and not by the plaintiffs in particular.

On April 9, 2021, the plaintiffs appealed the decision to the Collegiate Tribunal arguing that they are in a special situation in the legal system and, therefore, have a differentiated grievance from the rest of the society. The plaintiffs, as young people, argue that they will suffer greater consequences of climate change in the future, and therefore have a particular interest in defending their right to a healthy environment. Not recognizing their legal standing to demand effective climate change mitigation policies from their authorities means, in practice, closing the doors of access to constitutional justice.

On May 12, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a Request to the Supreme Court of Justice to exercise the power of attraction (Solicitud de Ejecricio de la Facultad de Atraccion or SEFA in Spanish) to request the Circuit Collegiate Tribunal to send the appeal to the Supreme Court of Justice. The appeal is based on the legal standing of young people in environmental cases to collectively demand action in case of a violation of the right to a healthy environment, in particular the right to a safe climate. This is the first case to reach the Mexican Supreme Court making the claim that young people have legal standing to sue the State in climate change cases, because young people are the ones who will suffer greater climate consequences in the future.

On June 29, 2022, the Supreme Court decided to hear the appeal. On December 7, 2022, the Supreme Court decided that the plaintiffs did not have legal standing to file the lawsuit against the amendments to the Electric Industry Law, because they are not in a special position that differentiates them from the rest of the society.

Ville de Paris and Others v. European Commission,"In 2007, the European Union (EU) legislature established a harmonized framework for the approval of motor vehicles to facilitate their registration, sale, and entry into service in the EU. Within this framework, the European Commission adopted Regulation 2016/646 to set up a procedure for testing the real driving emissions of certain motor vehicles to better reflect the emissions measured on the road. This Regulation was supplemented by Commission Regulation 2016/646, which establishes limits for emissions not to be exceeded during tests.

On June 26, June 29, and July 16, 2016, respectively, the City of Paris, the City of Brussels, and the Municipality of Madrid brought an action before the General Court to annul Regulation 2016/646. The cities argued that the regulation would prevent them from imposing restrictions on the circulation of passenger vehicles in relation to their air pollutant emissions. The Commission raised the objection that the contested regulation was not of direct concern to the applicants within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). 

In its judgment of December 13, 2018, the General Court partially upheld the actions and held that the contested regulation was of direct concern to the applicants. The General Court considered the regulation a regulatory act which does not entail implementing measures and which directly affects the cities powers to regulate the circulation of motor vehicles. On February 23, 2019, the Commission appealed to the European Court of Justice.

On January 13, 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) set aside the judgement of the General Court, in particular the interpretation by the General Court of Directive 2007/46. The ECJ clarified that for the applicants to be directly concerned by the regulation (and therefore, for the action to be admissible), two conditions must be met. First, the contested measure must directly affect the legal situation of the applicant. Secondly, it must leave no discretion to the entity entrusted with the implementation. The ECJ held that the General Court erred when it stated that the cities were prevented from exercising their powers to regulate the circulation of passenger vehicles to reduce pollution. 

The disagreement between the General Court and the ECJ revolved around article 4, paragraph 3, second subparagraph of Directive 2007/46, which mentions that member states shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the registration, sale, entry into service or circulation on the road of vehicles, [...] if they satisfy the requirements of the [Directive]. The General Court inferred from the inclusion of the words circulation on the road that the Directive restricted the regulatory powers of the local governments to adopt traffic restrictions for vehicles. As a result, the Directive and its implementing acts directly affect the legal position of the cities. 

The ECJ, however, ruled that the negative obligation in the second subparagraph of article 4, paragraph 3 must be read together with the first subparagraph. The first subparagraph gives the member states a positive obligation to register or permit the sale or entry into service only of such vehicles, components and separate technical units as satisfy the requirements of this Directive, without any mention of circulation on the road. As the two subparagraphs are complementary, the ECJ concluded that the General Court erred when it gave the second subparagraph a broader meaning. As a consequence, the General Court also erred when it derived from this that the cities were directly affected, and thus directly concerned, by the contested Regulation. 

The ECJ also mentioned that the obligations Directive 2007/46 imposes on Member States only concern placing motor vehicles on the market and not their subsequent use. Moreover, the cities are not liable to infringe on Directive 2007/46 (read together with Commission Regulation 2016/646) solely by adopting environmental protection legislation to limit the local circulation of certain vehicles. Through its judgment, the ECJ clarified that local governments do not violate the EU framework for testing real driving emissions when they adopt low-emission zones.",Decided,"['European Union>European Court of Justice', 'European Union>General Court (known as Court of First Instance before 2010)']",['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],"['European Union>Secondary Law>Regulations>Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/646', 'European Union>Secondary Law>Directives>2007/46/EC']",Whether a Commission regulation fixing emission values for real driving emissions tests for new light vehicles prevents local governments from imposing restrictions on the circulation of passenger vehicles in relation to their pollutant emissions.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/germany-v-ville-de-paris-and-others/
DS-600: European Union and Certain Member States  Certain Measures Concerning Palm Oil and Oil Palm Crop-Based Biofuels,"Complainant: Malaysia
Respondent: European Union; France; Lithuania
Third Parties: Argentina; Australia; Brazil; Canada; China; Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; El Salvador; Guatemala; Honduras; India; Indonesia; Japan; Korea, Republic of; Norway; Russian Federation; Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of; Singapore; Thailand; Turkey; Ukraine; United Kingdom; United States.

In 2018, the Renewable Energy Directive Recast (RED II) came into force in the European Union. RED II introduces measures to phase out biofuels which pose high risk significant GHG emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC), which is defined as occurring where there is cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes.
The European Commissions Delegated Regulation 2019/807 (Delegated Regulation) introduced pursuant to RED II laid down the criteria for determining high-ILUC feedstock and certifying low ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Based on the criteria set by the EU biofuel measures in determining high ILUC-risk fuels, only palm-oil-based biofuels, which are usually imported, will be phased out by 2030 (unless certified as low ILUC-risk). By contrast, biofuels based on oil crops, which are more likely to be produced domestically in EU, such as sunflower or rapeseed, are not subject to the phase out.

Following the introduction of RED II and the Delegated Resolution, France introduced a new law on fuel tax. The new fuel tax regime provides incentives for the consumption of petrol and diesel that contain certain crop-based biofuels to meet EU renewable energy targets. It provides expressly under the French Customs Code that palm-oil products are not considered as biofuels. Lithuania also amended its law on renewable energy, providing that by 2030, the share of fuels produced from feedstocks considered as high ILUC-risk feedstocks are to gradually decrease to nil for the calculation of Lithuania's gross final consumption of energy from renewable sources. 

On January 15, 2021, Malaysia brought a claim against the EU, France and Lithuania at the WTO. Malaysia claimed that certain measures imposed by virtue of RED II, including the criteria for determining the high ILUC-risk feedstock, and the sustainability and GHG emission savings criteria are discriminatory against palm-oil-based biofuels and are therefore inconsistent with various provisions under the TBT Agreement and GATT 1994. In summary, Malaysia has contended that the EU measures are inconsistent with:
(a)	Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 as they discriminate among 'like' feedstocks and derived biofuels originating in third countries;
(b)	Article III:4 as they accord less favorable treatment to imported palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels than they do to 'like' domestic feedstocks and derived biofuels, thereby modifying the conditions of competition to the detriment of the imported palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels, in particular from Malaysia
(c)	Article X:3(a) of GATT 1994 as they were administered in a manner that is not uniform, impartial and/or reasonable; 
(d)	Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994 as they restrict the importation of palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels; 
(e)	Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement as they have a detrimental impact on the competitive conditions in the EU market of Malaysia's imports of oil palm crop-based biofuels compared with 'like products' imported into the EU from other countries and compared with 'like' domestic products;
(f)	Article 2:2 of the TBT Agreement as they are more trade-restrictive than necessary to achieve the objectives pursued by the measures
(g)	Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement as they are not based on the relevant international standards
(h)	Article 2.5 of the TBT Agreement as EU has failed, upon the request of Malaysia, to explain the justification for those measures in terms of Articles 2.2 to 2.4 of the TBT Agreement
(i)	Article 2.8 of the TBT Agreement as they are based on an abstract and unsubstantiated high-ILUC risk concept instead of the performance of such biofuels;
(j)	Article 2.9 of the TBT Agreement as they were adopted without the required timely publication and notification of these measures and organising an adequate process for commenting;
(k)	Article 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement as they treat suppliers of oil palm crop-based biofuels from Malaysia less favourably than domestic suppliers of 'like' biofuels or suppliers from other WTO Members in a comparable situation;
(l)	Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement as they create unnecessary obstacles to international trade;
(m)	Article 5.2 of the TBT Agreement as EU failed to make available the conformity assessment procedures to certify low ILUC-risk;
(n)	Article 5.6 of the TBT Agreement as EU neither notified nor enter into meaningful consultations, or allowed for comments on such conformity assessment procedures;
(o)	Article 5.8 of the TBT Agreement as EU neither promptly published nor otherwise made available the measures at issue, which provide criteria for certifying low ILUC-risk biofuels, being conformity assessment procedures within the meaning of Annex 1.3 of the TBT Agreement; and
(p)	Articles 12.1 and 12.3 of the TBT Agreement as EU, in the preparation and application of the measures, failed to take into account the circumstances specific to developing countries, in particular Malaysia, where palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels are produced.
In respect of the measures imposed by Lithuania, Malaysia has contended that they are inconsistent the same provisions in GATT 1994 and the TBT Agreement as set out above.

As for the measures implemented by France, Malaysia has contended that they are inconsistent with:
(a)	Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 as the measures at issue, under which the tax on petrol and diesel is only reduced when they contain biofuels other than oil palm crop-based biofuels, discriminates against 'like' biofuels by granting an advantage, in the form of a tax reduction, to biofuels of some countries, that is not granted to all WTO Members, and in particular not to Malaysia, 
(b)	Article III:2 of the GATT 1994 as the measures at issue, under which the tax on petrol and diesel is only reduced when they contain biofuels other than oil palm crop-based biofuels, indirectly applies a tax on imported oil palm crop-based biofuels: (1) in excess to 'like' domestic biofuels; or (2) which is not similar to the tax on 'directly competitive and substitutable' domestic biofuels, and affords protection to the production of these domestic biofuels
(c)	Articles 3 and 5 of the SCM Agreement as the measures at issue, under which the French Government reduces the tax on petrol and diesel containing crop-based biofuel other than oil palm crop-based biofuels and excludes petrol and diesel containing oil palm crop-based biofuels from this tax reduction, amount to a subsidy within the meaning of Article 1 of the SCM Agreement which is: (1) a prohibited import substitution subsidy within the meaning of Article 3.1(b); and/or (2) an actionable subsidy causing an adverse effect on the interests of Malaysia within the meaning of Article 5(c) of the SCM Agreement

The EUs contention is that the measures are not in breach of its WTO obligations. EU has also submitted that the measures implemented are justified as they are intended to pursue EUs legitimate policy objectives of climate change mitigation, environmental protection, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring energy security and sustainability.

Organizacion de Ambientalistas Organizados v. Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development,"On December 30, 2021, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development published Resolution 436/2021 approving the implementation of an offshore seismic acquisition project submitted by the Norwegian company Equinor. This approval of offshore fossil fuel exploration resulted in several lawsuits seeking an injunction to halt the project and an order declaring the approvals regulations null and void. Some of those lawsuits are, partially, grounded on climate concerns. Other relevant cases can be found <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/guillermo-tristan-montenegro-v-ministry-of-environment-and-sustainable-development/"">here</a> and <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-argentina-et-al-v-argentina-et-al/"">here</a>.

On January 7, 2022, the NGO Organizacion de Ambientalistas Organizados sued the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development for its approval of the offshore exploration activities. Initially, the claim was presented as a habeas corpus for the protection of the Southern Right Whale and its habitats, but after the dismissal of the claim by the Federal Court, the Court of Appeal admitted it and asked for its conversion into a constitutional collective action (amparo ambiental colectivo). The main focus of the new claim remained the protection of the Southern Right Whale, but also introduced concerns regarding the climate impacts of the project. On these issues, the lawsuit refers to the urgency raised by the IPCC reports, the projects incompatibility with the available carbon budget (citing the 2021 International Energy Agency reports), the Argentinian NDC, and, more generally, the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. 

On January 14, 2022, all the three climate lawsuits against the offshore exploration activities (together with other non-climate related cases) were combined, and the court will hand down a single judgment for all.  

On February 11, 2022, the Federal Court of Mar del Plata ordered a halt to the fossil fuel exploration activities. The order does not make any mention of climate change concerns. Instead, the judge focuses on failures regarding procedural rights (participation and information) with explicit mention of the Escazu Agreement, lack of strategic environmental assessment, and possible risk to marine biodiversity. In the decision, the precautionary principle plays a key role. On February 15, 2022, the government filed an appeal to the injunction order. In its appeal, the government is also asking for the removal of the judge from the case. On February 18, 2022, a different judge (Federal Court of Mar del Plata N.4) allowed the appeal to proceed with suspensive effect. That means that the exploration activity can go ahead until the Federal Court of Appeal revises the injunction order.  

On June 3, 2022, the Federal Court of Appeal (Federal Chamber of Mar del Plata) annulled the injunction relief delivered by the Federal Court on February 11, 2022. However, at the same time, the Court ordered the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, as a new injunction, to issue a new complementary environmental impact assessment that considers possible cumulative impacts of the activities. In this new assessment, the spatial and temporal scope of the project's implementation must be analyzed and weighed. It is also mandatory to include the participation of the National Parks Administration and to consider the results of the public consultative hearings, organized at both local (public hearing initiated on 30 May 2022), and national levels (public consultation which ended on 19 May 2022). Finally, the Court asked for the inclusion of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in the control and monitoring of compliance with the Environmental Impact Statement and its corresponding Environmental Management Plan (a task before assumed only by the Secretary of Energy). In this sense, exploration activities should stop (again) until all these requirements are met. Climate arguments were not developed by the Court of Appeal.

On December 5, 2022, the Federal Court of Appeal (Federal Chamber of Mar del Plata) considered that the authority had met all the requirements asked in its order of June 3th. That implies the termination of the injunction and, therefore, the exploration activity can go ahead until a final decision on the merits is delivered. Climate arguments are, once again, absent in the Court of Appeal's decision. The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal this decision before the Supreme Court.

On January 13, 2022, the Mayor of the City of Mar del Plata filed a constitutional collective action (amparo colectivo ambiental) against the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development for its approval of the offshore exploration activities. Among other concerns regarding access to environmental information and participation in the decision making-process (citing the Escazu Agreement), the claim mentions that the project undermines Argentinas international climate commitments (UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, and NDC to the Paris Agreement), that the NDC is not sufficiently ambitious, that the National Adaptation and Mitigation Plan is missing, and that, ultimately, there is regulatory incoherence between the project and the climate pledges.

In this new assessment, the spatial and temporal scope of the project's implementation must be analyzed and weighed. It is also mandatory to include the participation of the National Parks Administration and to consider the results of the public consultative hearings, organized at both local (public hearing initiated on 30 May 2022), and national levels (public consultation which ended on 19 May 2022). Finally, the Court asked for the inclusion of the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development in the control and monitoring of compliance with the Environmental Impact Statement and its corresponding Environmental Management Plan (a task before assumed only by the Secretary of Energy). In this sense, exploration activities should stop (again) until all these requirements are met. Climate arguments were not developed by the Court of Appeal.

On December 5, 2022, the Federal Court of Appeal (Federal Chamber of Mar del Plata) considered that the authority had met all the requirements asked in its order of June 3th. That implies the termination of the injunction and, therefore, the exploration activity can go ahead until a final decision on the merits is delivered. Climate arguments are, once again, absent in the Court of Appeal's decision. The plaintiffs announced their intention to appeal this decision before the Supreme Court.

"Greenpeace Argentina et. al., v. Argentina et. al.","On December 30, 2021, the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development published Resolution 436/2021 approving the implementation of an offshore seismic acquisition project submitted by the Norwegian company Equinor. This approval of offshore fossil fuel exploration resulted in several lawsuits seeking an injunction to halt the project and an order declaring the approvals regulations null and void. Some of those lawsuits are, partially, grounded on climate concerns. Other relevant cases can be found <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/guillermo-tristan-montenegro-v-ministry-of-environment-and-sustainable-development/"">here</a> and <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/organizacion-de-ambientalistas-organizados-v-ministry-of-environment-and-sustainable-development/"">here</a>.

On January 13, 2022, a group of NGOs filed a constitutional collective action (amparo colectivo ambiental) against the Argentinian National State and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development for its approval of the offshore exploration activities. This case presents the climate impacts of the projects as the main grounds for its claims. Among others, plaintiffs mention that the project breaches national and international climate commitments and affects intergenerational equity, that the NDC to the Paris Agreement is insufficient, that the State is responsible not only for emissions within its territory but also for emissions arising from future fossil fuels exports, and that the Environmental Impact Assessment is flawed because it did not consider climate impacts. Notably, this claim refers to high-profile climate cases in other jurisdictions, like Urgenda (the Netherlands), Neubauer (Germany), Sharma (Australia); Earthlife Africa Johannesburg (South Africa); Gray and Gloucester Resources (Australia) and Greenpeace Nordic (Norway). 

On January 14, 2022, all the three climate lawsuits against the offshore exploration activities (together with other non-climate related cases) were combined, and the court will hand down a single judgment for all.  

On February 11, 2022, the Federal Court of Mar del Plata ordered a halt to the fossil fuel exploration activities. The order does not make any mention of climate change concerns. Instead, the judge focuses on failures regarding procedural rights (participation and information) with explicit mention of the Escazu Agreement, lack of strategic environmental assessment, and possible risk to marine biodiversity. In the decision, the precautionary principle plays a key role. On February 15, 2022, the government filed an appeal to the injunction order. In its appeal, the government is also asking for the removal of the judge from the case. On February 18, 2022, a different judge (Federal Court of Mar del Plata N.4) allowed the appeal to proceed with suspensive effect. That means that the exploration activity can go ahead until the Federal Court of Appeal revises the injunction order.

ADP Group (Paris Airports) v. Climate Activists,"On October 3rd, 2020, hundreds of environmental activists protested in front of Paris Charles de Gaulle airport to protest the construction of a new terminal. 84 of them illegally entered the tarmac and stood in front of a plane on the ground, in a parking area. According to a <a href=""https://www.leparisien.fr/seine-saint-denis-93/aeroport-de-roissy-relaxe-partielle-pour-les-militants-ecologistes-qui-avaient-envahi-le-tarmac-12-11-2021-YRW3JYZRZNGNVDS7PVBSUWDWTQ.php"">news report</a>, the ADP Group (Paris Airports) filed a claim against the activists for disturbing the operation of airport facilities. The 84 participants were subject to administrative proceedings and a fine of 750 euros each (for a total sum of 88,500 euros). In addition, seven of them, aged 20 to 43, were facing up to five years in prison and 18,000 euros in fines. Two of them were also subject to a complaint related to the destruction of a fence to let the other protestors in. The prosecutor requested sentences of one to three months suspended jail term (i.e., the sentence will be part of their criminal record but they will not serve any jail term unless they do a similar act within that period). 

In response to the prosecution, the activists argued they were acting according to their right to freedom of expression. Furthermore, they claimed that the seriousness of climate change meant they were acting in a state of necessity, which justifies an offense when necessary to warn of a future danger. In addition, they argued that they had tried protests and petitions before but that these did not alter the governments decision to build an additional terminal. In contrast, the government announced that it would abandon the T4 project after their climate action. 

On November 12th, 2021, the court acquitted the activists. The court found that the activists acted to raise awareness about the adverse effects of climate change. As such, the measures were justified as a state of necessity. The court also acquitted the activists for refusing to allow a police officer to take their DNA. The court further reclassified the offenses from serious damage to light damage and fined two of the defendants to 500 euros each for cutting the fence around the airport.

Bordeaux-Merignac Airport v Climate Activists,"On October 3rd, 2020, a national action led by ANV-COP21, Alternatiba and Extinction Rebellion led thousands of environmental activists to protest nationally in 18 French airports to denounce aviations greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to demand a reduction of air traffic and the development of alternative transport such as train rails. In Merignac-Bordeaux, seven climate activists climbed the airports fence (without damaging the fence) and stood at the end of the main runway where they deployed a banner and set off smoke flare.

The seven activists were prosecuted for obstructing the movement of an aircraft, which could not land on the tarmac where they were standing. The activists requested an acquittal and claimed that the seriousness of climate change deemed their action a state of necessity, which justifies an offense when proportionate, just and necessary to warn of a future danger. The Prosecutor requested a suspended fine of 500 euros. 

On March 29, 2020, the Bordeaux Court sentenced the seven activists to the payment of a 500 euros suspended fine.

Patrick Pouyanne (CEO of TotalEnergies) v. Greenpeace France,"On April 22, 2021, Greenpeace France, the anti-corruption group ANTICOR, and the student association La Sphinx lodged a complaint at the prosecutors office against Patrick Pouyanne, CEO of TotalEnergies (the French multinational oil and gas company also known as Total). The complainants claim there is a conflict of interest (prise illegale dinteret) by Mr. Pouyanne in establishing a Total research and development center dedicated to renewable energy in the campus of the Ecole Polytechnique, a French public institution of higher education and research. The conflict of interest derives from Mr. Pouyannes position as a board member of the Ecole. 

On June 21, 2018, the Ecoles Board of Directors gave an initial agreement in principle to set up a Total research and development center on the Ecoles campus. On September 20, 2018, Mr. Pouyanne was appointed to the Ecoles Board of Directors. At that time, the content of the partnership between the public institution and the oil company was still being defined. On June 25, 2020, the Board of Directors gave its final approval for the Total Research Center. According to the complaint, between September 2018 and June 2020, Mr. Pouyanne held a public service mission as a board member. From this role, he addressed fellow board members on behalf of Total to express the companys preferences on the development of the center.  

Conflict of interest under French law implies that a person in charge of a public service mission has an interest ""of some kind"" in a project that he or she has tried to influence. This influence may result from a simple power to issue an opinion on a decision taken by others. According to the complaint, Mr. Pouyanne used his position as member of the Board of Directors of the Ecole Polytechnique to influence the decision to establish the Total Research Center. The Total Research Center is expected to house, for over 50 years, several hundred Total employees (research and development teams), as well as a space for students and researchers from the Ecole. The Ecole Polytechnique is designed to train decision-makers for senior public administration. 

Following the complaint, the Public Prosecutor's Office initiated a preliminary investigation in May 2021. Once the investigation is completed, the Prosecutor's Office will decide on a course of action.

On September 30, 2020, the Alumni Association Sphinx filed an action for annulment (requete en annulation) of the Board of Directors June 25, 2020 decision to establish the center. The action is currently being examined by the Versailles Administrative Court.",Pending,"[""France>National Financial Prosecutor's Office""]","['Suits against corporations, individuals>Others']",['France>French Criminal Code'],Whether there was a conflict of interest created when an oil company executive served on the board of directors of a public institution that was deciding whether to establish a research center funded by the oil company.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/patrick-pouyanne-ceo-of-totalenergies-v-greenpeace-france/
Highlands District Community Association v. British Columbia (Attorney General),"Appeal from the dismissal of an application for judicial review of a Mines Inspectors decision to issue a permit to operate a rock quarry. The applicants questioned whether the decision was unreasonable because the Mines Inspector failed to consider the climate change impacts of the proposed quarry under the Mines Act. The appellant contends that climate change is such an important issue that the Mines Inspectors failure to consider it constituted a fettering of his discretion, resulting in an unreasonable decision. 

The reviewing judge held that the Mines Inspector had the discretion to consider the impacts of climate change but his failure to do so did not render his decision unreasonable. The request for interim injunctive relief was dismissed. While the Mines Inspectors statement of relevance was overly broad, his interpretation of the factors he is required to consider under the statutory scheme was reasonable. The broad discretion granted to the decision maker under the Mines Act imposes no mandatory requirements and the Mines Inspector provided extensive reasons for which he assessed the factors he considered relevant to the application before him. On June 14th, 2021, the Court of Appeal for British Columbia dismissed the claimant's appeal.

Company Workers Union of Maritima &amp; Commercial Somarco Limited and Others v Ministry of Energy,"On June 4, 2019, the Ministry of Energy, and the energy companies involved in decarbonization process, signed an Agreement on the phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric power plants. Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan contains a gradual closure of existing coal-fired power plants at the national level. Coal power plants accounted for 36.7% of energy generation in 2019 and for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Chiles goal is to reach carbon neutrality by 2005. As part of the decarbonization agreement, the government launched the process to elaborate a Just Energy Transition Strategy. 

Within this process, they initiated the discussion to generate local action plans for communities affected by coal-fired power plants. These local action plans may make it possible to diagnose the existing social, productive, environmental and territorial needs to generate actions resulting from participatory processes, with clear goals, indicators, deadlines and responsible parties. The plan seeks to reintegrate affected workers into the workforce. Furthermore, it creates mechanisms to safeguard the rights of workers during the transition process. However, on December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy issued the Supreme Decree No. 42, which ordered the implementation of a plan that ensures the reinsertion or reconversion of workers into the labor market without consulting with workers affected by the decarbonization plan.

On January 25, 2021, the three union workers brought a case against the Ministry of Energy. The plaintiffs argued that they were not consulted in the energy decarbonization agreements made between the government and the energy companies. This was in violation of their constitutional guarantees (Art. 19), which recognize the right to equality before the law, freedom of labor, freedom of association, and property rights

On March 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals of Antofagasta rejected the workers claims on procedural grounds (Case Rol No 318-2021). The Court found that the matter in question was beyond its competence, as it involved the exercise of powers belonging to the executive branch. It added that the Ministry of Energy does not have any labor relationship with the Ministry of Energy but rather with the companies in the energy sector. 

On August 9, 2021, the Chilean Supreme Court (Case No. 25. 530-2021) overruled the decision of the Court of Appeals and upheld the plaintiffs appeal. The ruling considered the closure of coal-fired plants as a part of Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The decision specifies that in this context, the agreements adopted by the State of Chile to achieve carbon neutrality require the performance of a just transition strategy both for the workers harmed by the loss of their direct and indirect source of employment and for the communities affected by the loss of services linked to the development of the declining thermoelectric activity, allowing the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. The lack of consultation was in violation of the governments obligation to ensure a just transition. The ruling ordered the government authorities to implement a plan for the reinsertion into the labor market of workers affected by the decarbonization process, consulting them in that process, and adopting the control measures to ensure compliance.",Decided,"['Chile>Court of Appeal of Antofagasta', 'Chile>Supreme Court']","['Suits against governments>Human Rights', 'Suits against governments>Just transition']","['Chile>Nationally Determined Contribution', 'Chile>Decree No 62/2006 (Regulation on Power Transfers between Generating Companies)', 'Chile>Decree No 50/2020 (on coal-fired power plant retirement agreements)', 'Chile>Constitution of Chile', 'UNFCCC']",Whether the government's energy decarbonization plan failed to include the participation of workers and violated their human rights under a just transition. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/company-workers-union-of-maritima-commercial-somarco-limited-and-others-with-ministry-of-energy/
"R. v Brown (Extinction Rebellion protest, London City Airport)","On October 10, 2019, a group of at least ten Extinction Rebellion protesters launched a protest at London City Airport. Their purpose was to cause disruption in order to draw attention to the contribution of air travel to climate change. The group included James Hugh Brown, a former Paralympic champion, who glued himself to the top of a commercial passenger aircraft. For this, he was convicted by the Crown Court for public nuisance and imprisoned for 12 months. He appealed both conviction and sentence.

On January 14, 2022, the Court of Appeal gave judgment, dismissing the appeal against conviction but allowing the appeal against sentence and substituting a four-month term of imprisonment. On his appeal against conviction, Mr Brown agued the court below should have stayed the prosecution for the common law offense of public nuisance (which has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment) as an abuse of process. This was because alternative statutory offenses were available, such as aggravated trespass (which has a maximum penalty of three months). Failure to stay, argued Mr Brown, amounted to a breach of his human rights (freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom of expression; and freedom of assembly and association). Rejecting these arguments, the Court held that the concept of abuse of process in a criminal case is the creature of domestic law and does not turn on any issue under the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998. On his appeal against sentence, Mr Brown argued the 12 months imprisonment was too long given the offense was committed in the course of protest. Instead, only a fine should have been imposed. The Court considered jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights on when a custodial sentence might be appropriate in the context of peaceful protest amounting to public nuisance. It agreed with the court below that Mr Browns offending passed the custody threshold. However, taking account his conduct (including that this was a peaceful protest), his previous convictions and his disability it held the 12 month sentence was manifestly excessive, and substituted a four-month sentence.",Decided,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>Court of Appeal>Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Protesters']","['United Kingdom>Criminal Code', 'United Kingdom>Human Rights Act 1998']",Whether choosing to prosecute an XR protester for the offense of public nuisance was an abuse of process where alternative statutory offenses were available. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/r-v-brown-extinction-rebellion-protest-london-city-airport/
KlimaSeniorinnen v Switzerland (ECtHR),"For a summary of the Swiss case, see <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/union-of-swiss-senior-women-for-climate-protection-v-swiss-federal-parliament/"">here</a>.

After having exhausted all national remedies available, with the final decision from the Swiss Supreme Court communicated to the parties in May 2020, on November 26, 2020 an association of senior women (Senior Women for Climate Protection Switzerland) took the Swiss government to the European Court of Human Rights because their health is threatened by heat waves made worse by the climate crisis. They also requested the case to be treated under the expenditure procedure pursuant to Article 41 of the Rules of the Court.

The application listed three main complaints: Switzerland's inadequate climate policies violate the women's right life and health under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR; the Swiss Federal Supreme Court's rejected their case on arbitrary grounds, in violation of the right to a fair trial under Article 6; and the Swiss authorities and courts did not deal with the content of their complaints, in violation of the right to an effective remedy in Article 13.

The ECtHR preliminary accepted the case and communicated it to the Swiss government on March 25, 2021. The ECtHR gave the case priority status and called on Switzerland to submit a response by July 16, 2021, which was timely filed.

On September 21, 2021, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and the Swiss Section of the ICJ submitted a third-party intervention providing observations on the effects of climate change on the right to life and the right to respect for private and family life and for the home and the positive obligations of States resulting from these rights, in light of principles of international environmental law, among other issues. The European Network of National Human Rights Institutions (ENNHR) also submitted a third-party intervention.

On October 13, 2021, the petitioner replied to the Swiss government's response to the ECtHR, arguing that the Swiss government failed to protect the Applicants' rights to life and private life under Arts. 2 and 8 ECHR, by failing to adopt the necessary legislative and administrative framework to do its share to prevent a global temperature increase of more than 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

On April 26, 2022, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights relinquished jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber of the Court. The case is now going to be examined by the ECtHR's Grand Chamber of 17 judges on account of the fact that the case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation of the Convention (Art 30 ECHR). 

On December 2, 2022, the applicants submitted a petition highlighting observations on the facts, admissibility and the merits.

Greenpeace Nordic and Others v. Norway,"After having exhausted all nation remedies available, with the final decision from the Norwegian Supreme Court issued on December 22, 2020, two NGOs (Greenpeace Nordic and Young Friends of the Earth (Nature and Youth)) and six individuals, filed an application before the European Court of Human Rights against the Norwegian government. For a summary of the case in Norway, see <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-nordic-assn-and-nature-youth-v-norway-ministry-of-petroleum-and-energy/"">here</a>. 

They argue that the Norwegian government (the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy), in issuing new licenses for oil and gas exploration in the Arctic (Barents Sea) that will allow new fossil fuels to market from 2035 and beyond, violated plaintiff's rights under Articles 2 (right to life) and 8 (right to respect for private life and family life and home) of the European Convention on Human Rights. They also allege that the Norwegian government has failed to adopt necessary and appropriate measures to address the risk of the climate crisis. Respondent has further failed to declare, describe and assess total climate effects, including exported emissions, of the continued and expanded extraction, thereby also infringing the Applicants rights. In addition, they argue that the Norwegian courts failed to adequately assess their claims and thus failed to provide plaintiffs access to an effective domestic remedy under Article 13 of the ECtHR.

On December 16, 2021, the Court characterized the case as a potential impact case and communicated it to the Norwegian State. On January 10, 2022, the Court published a list of questions to the parties and has given the Norwegian Government until 13 April, 2022 to respond to the allegations of the environmental groups that new oil and gas drilling in the Arctic breaches fundamental freedoms.

On April 27, 2022, Norway asked the European Court of Human Rights to dismiss the case or to find that there has been no violation. In its reply, the Norwegian State argues that the complaint should be declared inadmissible, and claims that Russias 2022 invasion of Ukraine justifies the search for more oil and gas today, thus increasing greenhouse gas emissions for another 30 years or more.

R (oao Friends of the Earth) v. Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy,"On January 12, 2022, Friends of the Earth (FoE) filed a claim for judicial review against the SoS, in relation to the Net Zero Strategy (NZS)  and the Heat and Buildings Strategy (HBS; the Governments strategy to decarbonize homes and buildings) arguing that both strategies were unlawfully adopted. The NZS is the Governments economy-wide decarbonization strategy. The CCA was the first piece of legislation anywhere in the world to set domestically enforceable carbon reduction targets. Sections 13 and 14 of the CCA require the SoS to produce policies which will enable upcoming carbon budgets set under the CCA to be met (s.13), and to report on those policies to parliament (s.14). 

The environmental legal charity, ClientEarth, and the NGO, Good Law Project (GLP), filed separate judicial review challenges to the NZS in the week commencing 17 January 2022, also in relation to the CCA. In relation to the NZS, all three claimants argued that the SoS breached sections 13 and 14 of the CCA. FoE also argued that the SoS breached section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 through failing to consider the impact of the HBS on people with protected characteristics. Research shows that people with certain protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010, such as people of colour, people with disabilities and older people, are disproportionately impacted by issues such as energy poverty. GLP also brought a separate ground in relation to human rights, under s.3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). They argued that s.13 and s.14 of the CCA had not been interpreted in way that is compatible with the Governments human rights obligations, including Article 8 (right to private and family life).

The three claimants all received permission to proceed on all grounds on March 1, 2022. The court found that the cases all had realistic prospects of success, and merited a full substantive hearing. On April 7, 2022 the SoS conceded on FoEs HBS ground, confirming that he had breached his public sector equality duty and was undertaking an equality impact assessment of the HBS (FoE had identified through an Environmental Information Request, that he had not done one previously). The substantive hearing for the three cases took place on 8 and 9 June 2022 before Mr Justice Holgate at the High Court. Following this, a separate hearing was listed on July 15, 2022 in relation to the evidence on the distinction between the quantified impacts of the policies in the NZS, and the emissions reduction delivery pathway. The latter, which was based on modelling for the potential for each sector across the economy to decarbonise, was included in the NZS but the former was not.

Following legal challenges brought by (1) Friends of the Earth, (2) ClientEarth and (3) Good Law Project and Joanna Wheatley, the High Court ruled on 18 July 18, 2022 that the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kwasi Kwarteng; the SoS) breached s.13 and s.14 of the Climate Change Act 2008 (CCA) when he adopted the NZS on 19 October 2021. Holgate J found that the NZS had been unlawfully adopted as:
1.	The Minister had legally insufficient information before him to adopt the NZS (breach of s.13 of the CCA). For example, whilst he had been informed that the quantified policies in the NZS added up to c.95% of the emissions reductions needed to meet the sixth carbon budget (CB6; set under the CCA, and covering the period 2033-2037), he had not been provided with the breakdown of the contributions of the individual policies, and it had not been explained to him how the 5% shortfall would be made up. This mean that he was not able to properly understand the risk to the delivery of the policies in the NZS. Risk to delivery was an obviously material consideration.
2.	The NZS itself lacked vital information which meant that Parliament and the public were unable to properly scrutinize it (breach of s.14 of the CCA). For example, Parliament was not aware of the 5% shortfall for meeting CB6. The NZS should have included quantified policies (i.e. setting out what their individual emissions reductions were estimated to be), in order for Parliament to be able to scrutinize risk to delivery. The judgment placed considerable weight on the views of the Committee on Climate Change, the independent expert body under the CCA, which had advised the Government that the NZS should include quantified policies.

Students for Climate Solutions v Minister of Energy and Resources,"On November 9, 2021 a group of law students sued the New Zealand Minister for Energy and Resources, challenging the Minister's June 2021 decision to grant permits for onshore oil and gas exploration. The students seek a judicial review of the permitting decision. The students claim the minister's June 2021 decision to issue exploration permits in the Taranaki area is inconsistent with the governments legal obligations under the countrys Zero Carbon Act and the Paris agreement and that she failed to consider key facts like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changes recent warnings about climate changes severity.

Police v Hanafin,"Four protesters were charged with trespass for the occupation of an offshore oil platform. The protesters pled guilty prior to hearing. The protesters argued that the action was peaceful, and genuinely motivated by a belief, founded on a basis of scientific consensus, as to the nature and effects of climate change, and therefore necessary to respond to the threat of harm. 

On November 13, 2020, the judge gave the sentencing. The judge accepted that anthropogenic climate change and its effects are undeniable, and that there is a right to freedom of expression. The judge accepted that without activism, change may be too late. However, she said, activism does not necessarily mean civil disobedience, and peaceful civil disobedience cannot be condoned where it infringes the genuine existing rights of another. In this case, there was an obligation not to interfere with a corporation carrying out its rights, where current New Zealand laws permit exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. The protesters should have sought law reform, and to educate the public without breaching the law. Nonetheless, the protesters' genuine belief in the correctness of their course, their early guilty pleas, and their otherwise good character were considered to be personal mitigating features. Aggravating features were the duration of the offending and the financial loss to the complainant. The protesters were convicted and discharged without penalty.

DS-593: European Union  Certain measures concerning palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels,"Complainant: Indonesia
Respondent: European Union
Third Parties: Argentina; Australia; Brazil; Canada; China; Colombia; Costa Rica; Ecuador; Guatemala; Honduras; India; Japan; Malaysia; Norway; Russian Federation; Singapore; Korea, Republic of; Thailand; Turkey; United States

In 2018, the Renewable Energy Directive Recast (RED II) came into force in the European Union. RED II introduces measures to phase out biofuels which pose high risk significant GHG emissions from indirect land-use change (ILUC), which is defined as occurring where there is cultivation of crops for biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels displaces traditional production of crops for food and feed purposes.
The European Commissions Delegated Regulation 2019/807 introduced pursuant to RED II laid down the criteria for determining high-ILUC feedstock and certifying low ILUC-risk biofuels, bioliquids and biomass fuels. Based on the criteria set by the EU biofuel measures in determining high ILUC-risk fuels, only palm-oil-based biofuels, which are usually imported, will be phased out by 2030 (unless certified as low ILUC-risk). By contrast, biofuels based on oil crops, which are more likely to be produced domestically in EU, such as sunflower or rapeseed, are not subject to the phase out.

On December 9, 2019, Indonesia brought a claim against the EU at the WTO. Indonesia claimed that certain measures imposed by virtue of RED II, including the criteria for determining the high ILUC-risk feedstock, and the sustainability and GHG emission savings criteria are discriminatory against palm-oil-based biofuels and are therefore inconsistent with their obligations in violation of
(a)	Article 2.2 of the TBT Agreement as the measures at issue appear to create unnecessary obstacles to international trade in oil palm crop-based biofuels going beyond what is required for achieving a legitimate objective;
(b)	Article 2.1 of the TBT Agreement as the measures at issue appear to discriminate among like biofuels of different origins, and between imported oil palm crop-based biofuels and like biofuels of EU origin;
(c)	Article 2.4 of the TBT Agreement as EU appears to have failed to use relevant international standards as a basis for its technical regulations; 
(d)	Article 2.5 of the TBT Agreement as the EU appears to have failed, upon the request of Indonesia, to explain the justification for those measures in terms of Articles 2.2 to 2.4 of the TBT Agreement;
(e)	Article 2.8 of the TBT Agreement, because by regulating trade in biofuels based on a description of an abstract and unsubstantiated high-ILUC risk concept instead of the performance of such biofuels; 
(f)	Article 2.9 of the TBT Agreement by adopting a technical regulation that has a significant effect on trade of other Members in circumstances where either a relevant international standard does not exist or the content of the technical regulation does not accord with a relevant international standard without the required publication and notification of that regulation and organising an adequate process for commenting;
(g)	Article 5.1.1 of the TBT Agreement by preparing, adopting or applying conformity assessment procedures for certifying only oil palm crop-based biofuels as low ILUC-risk, the European Union appears to treat suppliers of oil palm crop-based biofuels from Indonesia less favorably than suppliers of like biofuels from other countries, in a comparable situation
(h)	Article 5.1.2 of the TBT Agreement by preparing, adopting or applying conformity assessment procedures for certifying oil palm crop-based biofuels as low ILUC-risk, the European Union appears to create unnecessary obstacles to international trade;
(i)	Article 5.2 of the TBT Agreement by failing to make available conformity assessment procedures for certifying oil palm crop-based biofuels as low ILUC-risk;
(j)	Article 5.6 of the TBT Agreement by requiring certification that has a significant effect on trade of other Members in circumstances where either a relevant international standard does not exist or the content of the conformity assessment procedures does not accord with a relevant international standard without the required publication and notification of that certification procedure and organising an adequate process for commenting;
(k)	Article 5.8 of the TBT Agreement by failing to publish promptly or otherwise make available the conformity assessment procedures for low ILUC-risk certification;
(l)	Articles 12.1 and 12.3 of the TBT Agreement by failing to take into account, in the preparation and application of the technical regulations and conformity assessment procedures at issue, circumstances specific to the developing countries where palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuel are produced, the European Union appears to have failed to ensure that those measures do not create unnecessary obstacles to exports from developing country Members;
(m)	Article XI:1 of the GATT 1994 as the measures at issue appear to restrict importation of palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels
(n)	Article I:1 of the GATT 1994 as the measures at issue appear to discriminate among like crops and biofuels originating in third countries;
(o)	Article III:4 of the GATT 1994 as the measures at issue appear to discriminate between imported palm oil and oil palm crop-based biofuels and like products of EU origin; and
(p)	Article X:3(a) of the GATT 1994 as by adopting the criteria laid down in Articles 3 to 5 of Delegated Regulation 2019/807, the EU appears to have failed to administer RED II in a reasonable, impartial and uniform manner. 

The EUs contention is that the measures are not in breach of its WTO obligations. EU has also submitted that the measures implemented are justified as they are intended to pursue EUs legitimate policy objectives of climate change mitigation, environmental protection, preserving biodiversity, and ensuring energy security and sustainability.

ClientEarth v Poland (on behalf of M.G.),"ClientEarth, on behalf of a private citizen, brought an action against the Polish government alleging human rights violations for their failure to protect the citizen from the worsening effects of climate change. The case names the State Treasury as the defendant, represented by Minister for Climate and Environment, Minister for State Assets, Minister for Development, Labour and Technology, Minister for Infrastructure, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Minister for Funds and Regional Policy. The plaintiff asks the court to determine the defendant's liability resulting from the public authorities allowing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the territory of Poland in excess of the fair share. The plaintiff alleges this resulted in violations of the right to enjoy the value of the natural environment, including the right to live in stable and safe climatic conditions, health, respect for the place of residence, the right to privacy and respect for family life.

The claim was brought by ClientEarth pursuant to Article 61  1(2) of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure on behalf of M. G., who they claim was wronged by the actions of public authorities resulting in the infringement or threat to her personal rights. The alleged conduct of the State authorities, for which the State Treasury bears responsibility, consists of a series of acts and omissions which have the effect of allowing excessive GHG emissions from the territory of the State, contributing to the deepening of the global warming effect leading to irreversible and dangerous climate change which directly affects the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims she is already suffering from the effects of climate change, which have a clear impact on her life at her place of residence. These include, in particular, heavy rainfall, prolonged droughts and extreme weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, fires and gusty winds, which spread fire and cause sandstorms, all of which are damaging to human health. The plaintiff claims these events are unprecedented in relation to previous decades, when similar phenomena were characterised by much lower frequency, scale, and intensity. 

Poland is among the largest emitters within the European Union, ranking among the top three member states in terms of total CO2 emissions, emissions per capita and emissions in relation to GDP. In terms of climate policy, Poland also ranks among the lowest in international climate rankings, and its progress in reducing GHG emissions is assessed as incompatible with the Paris Agreement. Regardless of the results of the completed strategy, the fulfilment of the climate commitments of the European Union adopted for 2030 is considered to be at risk. 

The plaintiff alleges that the actions of public authorities leading to excessive GHG emissions are unlawful, which is the premise of Article 24 of the Polish Civil Code. Further, they result in a threat to fundamental human rights, guaranteed inter alia by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Member States are obliged to respect these rights not only by refraining from violating them, but also by taking measures to ensure that they are respected (so-called positive state obligations). However, adverse climate change caused by high emissions significantly interferes with individuals' ability to exercise such fundamental rights as the right to life (Article 2 ECHR) and the right to respect for private and family life and home (Article 8 ECHR). The plaintiff alleges that actively contributing to the exacerbation of the dangerous phenomenon of global warming is also in breach of numerous constitutional norms, including the obligation to prevent the negative effects of environmental degradation on health (Article 68(4) in conjunction with Article 68(1) of the Polish Constitution) and to protect the environment and ensure ecological safety for contemporary and future generations (Article 74(1) and (2) of the Polish Constitution). This action is also contrary to the principles of social co-existence, including the rule prohibiting causing harm to another.

The plaintiff seeks remedies based on a fair share analysis for Poland. The analysis presented by the plaintiff found that in order to make an equitable contribution to meeting the 1.5oC goal of the Paris Agreement, the Polish State must: (i) reduce national GHG emissions by 61% by 2030 (below 1990 levels); (ii) reach net zero emissions by 2043; and (iii) not exceed between 2020 and 2043 the carbon budget attributable to Poland of 4.1 Gt CO2eq.

On June 11, 2021, the District Court in omza found itself not competent to hear the case and transferred the case to the District Court in Warsaw for examination. ClientEarth appealed, and on September 8, 2021, the Court of Appeal in Biaystok reversed the decision of the District Court in omza.

I.L. v. Italian Ministry of the Interior and Attorney General at the Court of Appeal of Ancona,"On February 24, 2021, the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation (Corte Suprema di Cassazione) established in Ordinance 5022/2021 that the assessment that the trial judge carries out for the purpose of granting humanitarian protection should consider not only armed conflict scenarios but also situations of social, environmental or climate degradation, and situations in which natural resources are subjected to unsustainable exploitation in the country of origin. The Court clarified that humanitarian protection must be granted when, according to the assessment, the situation in the country of origin does not allow for a minimum essential limit of guarantee for the right to life of the individual.

The ordinance originates from the rejection by the Ancona Territorial Commission for the International Protection Recognition of an individual request for international or humanitarian protection. The applicant is a citizen of the Niger Delta region of Nigeria. The applicant appealed the rejection before the Tribunale di Ancona. Following a second negative decision, he appealed it before the Supreme Court of Cassation. In delivering its ordinance, the Court of Cassation specifically referred to the decision of the UN Human Rights Committee in the <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/un-human-rights-committee-views-adopted-on-teitiota-communication/"">Teitiota case</a>.

A key passage from the ruling (Pp.8-9): For the purpose of recognizing, or denying, humanitarian protection [...], the concept of ineradicable core constituting the foundation of personal dignity identified by the jurisprudence of this Court [...] is the minimum essential limit below which the right to life and the right to a dignified existence of an individual are not guaranteed. That limit must be appreciated by the trial judge not only with specific reference to the existence of a situation of armed conflict, but in relation to any context that is, in practice, able to put the fundamental rights to life, liberty and self-determination of the individual at risk of zeroing or reduction below the aforementioned minimum threshold, therein specifically including  if their existence in a given geographical area is concretely established  situations of environmental disaster, [...] climate change, and unsustainable exploitation of natural resources.",Decided,['Italy>Supreme Court of Cassation'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Climate migration'],['Italy>Consolidated Immigration Act (Legislative Decree) No. 286/1998'],"Whether to grant humanitarian protection to individuals exposed to a real risk to their right to life in the country of origin when such risk is due to an adverse social, environmental and climate situation and not to an armed conflict.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/il-v-italian-ministry-of-the-interior-and-attorney-general-at-the-court-of-appeal-of-ancona/
Rete Legalita per il Clima (Legality for Climate Network) and others v. ENI,"On February 14, 2022, a group of Italian NGOs and environmental movements submitted a climate-related complaint to the National Contact Point of the OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) alleging the inadequacy of the business plan pursued by the oil company ENI. Specifically, the complaint highlights that ENI has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, but its actions run contrary to this goal. For example, ENI plans to increase its oil production by 4% each year until at least 2024, and is proposing to rely on large amounts of negative emissions technology (7 million tonnes of CO2 stocked each year by 2030). The complaint alleges that ENI has not complied with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises due to: (i) the fact that the company's strategic plan does not foresee a sufficient cut in GHG emissions in the coming years; (ii) the lack of a climate impact assessment of the company's activities; (iii) the absence of transparent and adequate information; and (iv) the failure to develop a plan for risk prevention and mitigation. As the National Contact Point is a non-judicial grievance mechanism, the applicants have requested mediation with ENI.

Sendai Citizens v. Sendai Power Station,"On September 27, 2017, 124 citizens in Sendai instituted a lawsuit against the Sendai Power Station seeking an injunction to the operation of the power plant. The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the Sendai Power Station violated (i) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity (Jinkaku-ken) due to the health damage caused by the emission of environmental pollutants, (ii) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity due to climate change, and (iii) the right to maintain biodiversity due to the emission of hazardous substances. Firstly, the plaintiffs argued that the emissions of pollutants, such as SOx and NOx, caused significant health damage by increasing the risks of various illnesses. Secondly, the plaintiffs argued that their personal rights were violated as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would worsen climate change, which causes extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy rains. To support this argument, they stated that the current use of coal-fired power plants was incompatible with the GHG emissions reduction targets in Japan and was also an obstacle to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thirdly, the plaintiffs claimed that environmental rights, including the right to maintain biodiversity, should be recognized based on Article 13 of the Constitution. 

Those three arguments are later modified to the tort claims based on the right to a peaceful life, which they claimed was violated by environmental pollution, personal rights concerning life and bodily integrity, which they claimed were violated by climate change, and the right to maintain biodiversity. During the proceedings, the right to maintain biodiversity was excluded from the points of dispute by the parties based on the Courts determination that the right to maintain biodiversity is not recognized under Japanese civil law. Similarly, the plaintiffs indicated in the 10th preparatory document that they withdrew their claim based on the personal rights to life and bodily integrity, and thus, the second argument related to climate change was removed from the points of dispute.

On October 28, 2020, the Sendai District Court delivered a judgment, which solely discussed the right to a peaceful life focusing on environmental pollution. The Court rejected the plaintiffs claim by saying that neither the nature nor the level of environmental pollution was serious and that the evidence provided by the plaintiffs lacked objectivity and credibility. The court did not rule on GHG emissions because they were part of the second argument, which were modified before the ruling. The Court further mentioned that the business operator had social accountability to do its best to relieve the citizens concerns about environmental pollution.

On December 22, 2020, one citizen filed an appeal. In the statement of appeal, the appellant claimed that the district court has made 5 errors. Firstly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the initial complaint by equating the mental distress with the threat to life and bodily integrity, which was claimed by the plaintiffs. Secondly, he claimed that the court had misunderstood the scientific concepts and terms and thus failed to recognize the risks based on the scientific evidence. Thirdly, he claimed that the court should still have considered the issues of global warming and GHG emissions either as factors to counteract the public necessity of the power plant or as aggravating factors of the tort even if the violation of the plaintiffs rights by global warming was not discussed since the CO2 emission by the power plant was against the generally accepted idea in the modern society and national carbon neutral policies. Fourthly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the experts opinion concerning the concentration of PM 2.5 and thus failed to recognize the health risks. Lastly, he claimed that the court ignored the precedents and academic theories related to personal rights and air pollution. He argued that there was no public necessity for a new power plant and the protection of personal rights should be prioritized.

On April 27, 2021, Sendai High Court issued a judgment on the appeal. The parties did not dispute that the power plant could cause the emission of air pollutants. Thus, the issue discussed was whether the threat of damage to the appellants life and bodily integrity by the health impact due to the exposure to the air pollutants could be recognized as a violation of personal rights (either the physical rights or the right to a peaceful life) leading to the illegality of the operation of the power plant. The court ruled that while it could not deny that there was abstract danger, there was no sufficient evidence to recognize concrete danger to the appellants health. The amounts of emissions of PM 2.5 and NOx are within the normal range and the amounts of other pollutants, including mercury, were all lower than the environmental standards. The court believes that there is no indication that air pollution has worsened after the power plant started operating. As for the public necessity, the presence of surplus at one moment does not mean that there was no public necessity for the power plant since power demand and supply are easily influenced by various circumstances. Moreover, considering the current energy policy, usability and public nature of the power plant concerned cannot be denied while there is discussion and governmental policies to prevent global warming, such as 2050 Carbon-Neutral. Further, the court adds that no concrete danger to global warming nor biodiversity is recognizable. The court rejected the appeal and supported the first instance judgment. The court cannot find concrete danger, which exceeds the socially acceptable upper limits, to health when considering the nature and level of damage, the social usability, public nature, and preventive measures.

"Decision C-298/16 of June 8, 2016","A group of citizens filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of (among others) articles 20 and 173 of Law 1753 of 2015. These articles included rules for allowing mining activities in sensitive, high-altitude ecosystems known as paramos and gave the Colombian mining authority the indefinite power to delimit strategic areas for mining exploitation. Plaintiffs argued that paramos play a vital role in mitigating climate change, since they are natural carbon sinks and provide 70% of Colombian water supply. Claimants asserted that allowing mining activities in these areas will significantly impact Colombias climate change mitigation capacity, which can have transboundary impacts in neighboring countries, such as Ecuador and Venezuela. Plaintiffs contended that this Law lowered the previously existing duty of protection standard by allowing mining authorities to decide which paramo areas can host mining activities. In doing that, they argued the Colombian government violated its own constitutional provisions, as well as the obligations derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
  
Certain aspects of Law 1753s constitutionality had been analyzed in a separate case in response similar arguments. Hence, Colombias Constitutional Court declared res judicata and reiterated its previous Decision C-035/16 striking down parts of articles 20 and 173 of Law 1753 of 2015, which authorize the Colombian government to designate certain projects as being in the national interest and authorize projects in paramos received prior to certain dates. 

Regarding new arguments not analyzed in Decision C-035/16, the Constitutional Court struck down provisions of Law 1753 that allowed environmental authorities to designate mining areas without a temporal limit (among other provisions). The Court found the provision of an indefinite power to delimit strategic mining areas violated the right to a healthy environment and enjoyment of natural resources for both present and future generations. The Court underscored the incompatibility of granting indefinite powers to administrative authorities with the right to a healthy environment, since these delimited mining areas are likely to be selected for exploitation, which in turn could cause environmental harms to these sensitive and ecologically important areas.",Decided,['Colombia>Constitutional Court'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],"['American Convention on Human Rights>San Salvador Protocol', 'Economic and Cultural Rights', 'Colombia>Constitution', 'UNFCCC']","Whether the statutory provisions that allow mining activities in sensitive, high-altitude ecosystems (paramos) were constitutional.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/decision-c-298-16-of-june-8-2016/
"Decision SU-698/17 of November 28, 2017","Indigenous communities (Wayuu) filed a lawsuit against Colombian authorities and private companies due to the diversion of the Bruno River to conduct mining activities. Plaintiffs alleged violation of their fundamental rights to water, health, and food sovereignty. 

The Constitutional Court found that authorities authorization of mining activities ignored the particular social and environmental conditions of the region (La Guajira). In particular, the Court reasoned that climate change has significantly impacted the regions natural water supply. By failing to consider these climate change-related impacts, the defendants violated fundamental rights, especially those related to water supply. The Court underscored the relationship Wayuu communities have with water bodies in accordance with their worldviews. The risk posed by mining activities in a climate change-vulnerable region is of special importance and has the potential to cause significant harm. 

The Court ordered, among other actions, the continuity of a working group to ensure fundamental rights are observed and protected. This group was also ordered to conduct a study that answers a number of questions posed by the Court, including those on the social and environmental impacts of the diversion of the Bruno River. The Court ordered the private company to begin mitigation, prevention, control, compensation, and correction measures to address project-related social and environmental impacts.

"Combeima River case of September 14, 2020","A public servant in charge of defending, promoting, and protecting human rights in the Tolima region filed a popular action (accion popular) against the Ministry of Environment, the Mining Agency, two mining companies, and three individuals alleging the defendants violated the collective rights to a healthy environment and ecological balance, among others. The plaintiff argued that mining permits issued in the Combeima and Cocora rivers violated collective rights since these rivers have been designated areas of special environmental importance. The plaintiff invoked a potential damage to water quality and availability in relation to the constitutional right to a healthy environment (articles 79 and 80 of the Colombian Constitution). 

The court of first instance, the Administrative Tribunal, declared the Combeima, Cocora, and Coello rivers as subject of rights. However, in September 2020, during the appeal process, the Council of State (hereinafter the Court) reversed this declaration. The Court reasoned that the <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/atrato-river-decision-t-622-16-of-november-10-2016/"">Atrato River case</a> precedent was not applicable in this case since the cases differ in factual elements and legal arguments. Particularly, the Court underscored that, in this case, the mining activities have yet to be executed, whereas, in the Atrato River case, there was sufficient evidence of damage caused by mining activities.

Nevertheless, the Court found that the mining titles in this case had the potential to cause environmental damage to the Combeima and Cocora rivers. The Court invoked climate change as a main driver of water scarcity. The Court reasoned that environmental and mining authorities must take climate change into consideration when issuing environmental permits, as climate change relates to their obligation to prevent disasters.

ClientEarth v Poland (on behalf of M.S.),"ClientEarth, on behalf of a private citizen, brought an action against the Polish government alleging human rights violations for their failure to protect the citizen from the worsening effects of climate change. The case names the State Treasury as the defendant, represented by Minister for Climate and Environment, Minister for State Assets, Minister for Development, Labour and Technology, Minister for Infrastructure, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, and the Minister for Funds and Regional Policy. The plaintiff asks the court to determine the defendant's liability resulting from the public authorities allowing the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) from the territory of Poland in excess of the fair share. The plaintiff alleges this resulted in violations of the right to enjoy the value of the natural environment, including the right to live in stable and safe climatic conditions, health, respect for the place of residence, the right to privacy and respect for family life.

The claim was brought by ClientEarth pursuant to Article 61  1(2) of the Polish Code of Civil Procedure on behalf of M. S., who they claim was wronged by the actions of public authorities resulting in the infringement or threat to her personal rights. The alleged conduct of the State authorities, for which the State Treasury bears responsibility, consists of a series of acts and omissions which have the effect of allowing excessive GHG emissions from the territory of the State, contributing to the deepening of the global warming effect leading to irreversible and dangerous climate change which directly affects the plaintiff. The plaintiff claims she is already suffering from the effects of climate change, which have a clear impact on her life at her place of residence. These include, in particular, heavy rainfall, prolonged droughts and extreme weather phenomena such as thunderstorms, fires and gusty winds, which spread fire and cause sandstorms, all of which are damaging to human health. The plaintiff claims these events are unprecedented in relation to previous decades, when similar phenomena were characterised by much lower frequency, scale, and intensity. 

Poland is among the largest emitters within the European Union, ranking among the top three member states in terms of total CO2 emissions, emissions per capita and emissions in relation to GDP. In terms of climate policy, Poland also ranks among the lowest in international climate rankings, and its progress in reducing GHG emissions is assessed as incompatible with the Paris Agreement. Regardless of the results of the completed strategy, the fulfilment of the climate commitments of the European Union adopted for 2030 is considered to be at risk. 

The plaintiff alleges that the actions of public authorities leading to excessive GHG emissions are unlawful, which is the premise of Article 24 of the Polish Civil Code. Further, they result in a threat to fundamental human rights, guaranteed inter alia by the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. Member States are obliged to respect these rights not only by refraining from violating them, but also by taking measures to ensure that they are respected (so-called positive state obligations). However, adverse climate change caused by high emissions significantly interferes with individuals' ability to exercise such fundamental rights as the right to life (Article 2 ECHR) and the right to respect for private and family life and home (Article 8 ECHR). The plaintiff alleges that actively contributing to the exacerbation of the dangerous phenomenon of global warming is also in breach of numerous constitutional norms, including the obligation to prevent the negative effects of environmental degradation on health (Article 68(4) in conjunction with Article 68(1) of the Polish Constitution) and to protect the environment and ensure ecological safety for contemporary and future generations (Article 74(1) and (2) of the Polish Constitution). This action is also contrary to the principles of social co-existence, including the rule prohibiting causing harm to another.

The plaintiff seeks remedies based on a fair share analysis for Poland. The analysis presented by the plaintiff found that in order to make an equitable contribution to meeting the 1.5oC goal of the Paris Agreement, the Polish State must: (i) reduce national GHG emissions by 61% by 2030 (below 1990 levels); (ii) reach net zero emissions by 2043; and (iii) not exceed between 2020 and 2043 the carbon budget attributable to Poland of 4.1 Gt CO2eq.",Pending,['Poland>District Court'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other']","['Poland>Civil Code', 'European Convention on Human Rights']",Whether the Polish governments failure to protect plaintiff from the worsening effects of climate change violates personal and human rights,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/clientearth-v-poland-on-behalf-of-ms/

Sustaining the Wild Coast NPC and Others  v. Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy and Others,"On November 29, 2021, four environmental and human rights organizations (Sustaining the Wild Coast NPC, Mashona Dlamini, Dwesa-Cwebe Communal Property Association and four others) filed an application in the High Court of South Africa (Eastern Cape Division, Grahamstown) against respondents Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Shell and Impact Africa. The application sought an interdict prohibiting the respondents from proceeding with the seismic survey off the eastern coast of South Africa from 2021-2022. The seismic survey pursued by Shell and Impact Africa followed an exploration right granted on April 29, 2014. It aimed at providing imaging of the subsurface to determine whether there might be energy reserves below the sea floor. To succeed in their application, the applicants must establish: (i) at least a prima facie right (ii) a reasonable apprehension of irreparable and imminent harm of the right if the interim interdict is not granted; (iii) balance of convenience; and (iv) lack of an alternative satisfactory remedy.

In October 2021, Shells consultants gave notice of Shells intention to undertake a 3D seismic survey along the south-eastern coast. Following a public outcry, activists and affected communities approached the Eastern Cape High Court for an urgent interdict preventing Shell from proceeding with the seismic survey (Part A), pending the outcome in the present application (Part B). 

On December 17, 2021, the South African High Court held a hearing on Part A (an application for an interdict where the Applicants sought an order interdicting the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents from proceeding with a seismic survey pending the finalization of the relief). The Court delivered the judgement on December 28, 2021. The Court found that these requirements for an interdict were satisfactorily met by the applicants. It ruled that the exploration right which was awarded without regard to the applicants right to meaningful consultation constitutes a prima facie violation of their right which deserves to be protected by way of an interim interdict. The Court agreed that there is reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm and imminent harm of the right as the seismic survey will promote extraction of fossil fuels and adversely impact climate change, the applicant communities cultural practices, ocean conservation, and the spiritual and sustainable use of ocean for healing and fishing purposes. It acknowledged the concern of the communities that seismic survey will lead to exploration without climate impact assessment, a development that is inconsistent with South Africas agreement at the 2021 COP26 to move away from hydrocarbon-based energy towards climate friendly renewables. While finding the balance of convenience to be in favor of the applicants, the Court reasoned that the financial loss that respondents, especially Shell and Impact Africa, are likely to suffer cannot compare with the adverse effects of infringement of the constitutional rights of the communities. Finally, the Court reasoned that the procedure contemplated under section 47 of the MPRDA and argued by the respondents as a remedy is unacceptable in that it is a time-consuming procedure. If followed, it would allow the continuous threat of infringement of the applicants rights. A hearing on the main application is scheduled for May 2022. 

Shell and Impact Africa appealed the judgment of the High Court. On February 17, 2022, the judge dismissed the application. 

A hearing regarding Part B of the case was held on May 30-31, 2022. The High Court of South Africa (Eastern Cape Division, Makhanda) delivered the judgment on September 1, 2022. The principal question was whether the grant of an exploration right for oil and gas, resulting in the need to conduct a seismic survey along the South Coast of South Africa was lawful. The court was satisfied that the grounds for review in terms of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 with regards to the granting of the exploration right were met and it was thus set aside, together with the right to renew.  The judgment had the effect of setting aside an exploration right that would have enabled Shell to conduct seismic surveys off South Africas coastline, in its search for oil and gas reserves. 

In regard to the climate change impacts of the proposed seismic surveys, the Court referred to the applicants submissions regarding observed climate change impacts  including more unpredictable weather patterns and more extreme weather events  as well as expert testimony relating to unburnable fossil fuel reserves (i.e., most fossil fuel reserves should remain unextracted in order to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius) and the inconsistency of further oil and gas exploitation with South Africas international climate change commitments. The Court also found that the decision-maker had failed to take into account the considerations referred to in the Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2008, which obliges the State, as the public trustee of coastal public property, to ensure that coastal public property is managed and conserved on behalf of all South Africans, including future generations.

Tsama William and Others v. Uganda's Attorney General and Others,"On the October 14, 2020, the applicants (victims of recurring landslides in Bududa district, Uganda) filed a suit against the Attorney General (representing the Government), the National Environment Management Authority and the Bududa Local Government Council alleging that the respondents have failed to put in place an effective machinery against landslides in Bududa district, and that the respondents acts and/or omissions have led to the violation of applicants fundamental rights. 

On December 3, 2019, multiple landslides occurred in Bushika sub-county, Bududa district, displacing the applicants from their homes, killing 20 of the applicants relatives, and destroying property and the environment. The applicants argue that Bududa district, in the Mt Elgon region in Eastern Uganda, is an area prone to landslides, and according to several government documents set out in supporting affidavits, the respondents are fully knowledgeable of the recurring landslide problem in the area which has been exacerbated by climate change. The applicants argue that the respondents have positive obligations under national and international climate change and disaster management law to put in place an effective machinery for dealing with landslides in Bududa district. Despite their legal obligations, the respondents have failed to do so, thus violating the applicants fundamental rights including the right to life, the right to a clean and healthy environment, the right to property, and the right to physical and mental health. The applicants argue that the infringement of the applicants fundamental rights could have been avoided if the respondents had discharged their respective obligations under the law. The applicants argue that Bududa district is likely to suffer from more landslides in the future due to factors such as changing rainfall patterns and increasing extreme weather events caused by climate change and environmental degradation. If the affected people are not urgently relocated and resettled, further loss of life, loss of property and infringement of human rights is likely to occur. 

The applicants claim several reliefs from court including declarations that their fundamental rights to life, property, physical and mental health, and clean and healthy environment were infringed when the landslides occurred. The applicants further claim for a declaration that the respondents are responsible for the violation and infringement of their fundamental human rights. The applicants further claim a total of UGX 6,800,000,000 (Uganda shillings six billion eight hundred million) in damages and compensation for the loss of life, threats to life, destruction of property and infringement of their other fundamental human rights as well as the costs of resettlement to safer areas.

Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) v National Agency for Industrial Security and Environmental Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (ASEA),"In June 29, 2016, Mexico made a joint declaration with the governments of Canada and the United States pledging to reduce methane emissions by between 40 and 45% by 2025. Mexico, through the National Agency for Industrial Security and Environmental Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (ASEA) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), adopted its national guidelines for the integral prevention and control of methane emissions from the hydrocarbon sector as a way to implement this decision. The guidelines stipulate that any entity or person regulated by ASEA, like private companies or state-owned companies in the hydrocarbon sector, must establish a program for the monitoring, prevention, and control of methane emissions for both new and existing facilities. Originally, the guidelines ordered regulated entities to draft their programs within 12 months of the beginning of operations for new facilities or those still under construction and within 12 months of the guidelines coming into force for existing facilities. The new guidelines gave regulated entities a 3-month period to turn in their respective programs after they were drafted. However, in June 2020, the 3-month period outlined previously was expanded to 19 months. On August 7, 2020, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) challenged the modification for the submission of programs by suing ASEA and SEMARNAT. 

On August 23, 2021, the district court ruled that CEMDA lacked legal standing to challenge the decision since the modification did not cause a special injury to the organization. This decision has been appealed and is currently before the Third Collegiate Tribunal for Administrative Matters of the First Circuit. On March 17, 2022, the Collegiate Tribunal confirmed the district courts ruling, deciding that CEMDA lacked legal standing to challenge the modifications. Therefore, the case was dismissed.

Greenpeace v. Mexico (Budget reduction for combating climate change),"Under Mexican Law, the House of Representatives is tasked with creating expenditure and revenue bills every year. For the 2019 expenditure bill, the House of Representatives reduced funds assigned for climate change adaptation and mitigation by 36% in relation to the 2018 Expenditure Bill, according to Greenpeace. On January 21, 2019, Greenpeace Mexico challenged this reduction. On January 21, 2019, the district judge determined that the challenge was nonjusticiable since it would transgress the relativity principle under which no amparo trial decisions can have effects beyond the parties. Greenpeace appealed this decision to the appellate Collegiate Tribunal, and the appellate court in turn decided to petition the Supreme Court to resolve the case.  

The Supreme Court granted review. In its resolution, the Court reasoned that granting relief to Greenpeace would not transgress the relativity principle since the principle could be reinterpreted to mean that parties can get relief even if the relief incidentally benefits a third party. The Court remarked that the relativity principle cannot be interpreted to be an obstacle in the protection of the environment. Notwithstanding, it affirmed the district courts decision since the 2019 Expenditure Bill was no longer in force by the time the dispute arrived at the Supreme Court.

Ruling on the constitutionality of state green taxes in Zacatecas,"On December 31, 2016, the State of Zacatecas, Mexico published its 2017 Treasury Bill, Expenditure Bill and Revenue Bill. The Treasury Bill established a tax on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) produced by stationary sources.  A corporation dedicated to beer production sued the state legislature, challenging the constitutionality of the Treasury Bill of the State of Zacatecas. Specifically, the corporation argued that the State of Zacatecas was invading the national Congresss powers by introducing the tax. On October 31, 2017, the Second District Judge in the State of Zacatecas agreed that state authorities could not tax GHG emissions without overstepping on Congresss power. Particularly, the judge pointed to the fact that the Mexican Constitution reserves imposition of taxes on beers to federal authorities. Thus, it declared the taxes unconstitutional. State authorities appealed the decision to the appellate Collegiate Tribunal, and the Collegiate Tribunal sent the case to the Supreme Court for review. 

On February 20, 2020, the Supreme Court concluded that States were not prevented from implementing taxes on GHG emissions since, as a general rule, Federal and State authorities have joint powers to establish taxes unless the Mexican Constitution reserves a specific area to the federation. The Court noted that the tax on GHG emissions under analysis was not a tax on beer production but rather on the emission, deposition, or storage of substances in the atmosphere. The Court also noted that the State had acted pursuant to its responsibilities under Mexicos General Law on Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection and the General Law on Climate Change.
 
Responding to other arguments from the corporation, the Court noted that the tax intended to force polluters to internalize the costs of their GHG emitting activities, and this was a valid implementation of the polluter pays principle.  The Court also dismissed the corporations argument that the UNFCCC only called developed countries to take action on GHG emissions. In this sense, the Court noted that Mexican authorities have a duty to address the effects of climate change. Finally, the Court dismissed the argument that the tax was arbitrary since it only applied to GHG emissions and not to other gas emissions that also pollute the atmosphere. To do so, the Court carried out a proportionality analysis to conclude that the distinction made by the State was justified.

Ruling on Constitutionality of green taxes in Baja California,"On October 8, 2021, plaintiffs sued the legislature of the State of Baja California, challenging the validity of a tax introduced in the Treasury Bill of the State of Baja California. The rule aimed to curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by taxing gasoline, diesel, and gas sales. On July 8, 2021, the Eighth District Judge in the State of Baja California struck down the tax after reasoning that the tax invaded Congresss exclusive authority to impose taxes on gasoline and other fuels. State authorities appealed the decision. 

On November 30, 2021, The Fifth Collegiate Tribunal of the Fifteenth Circuit affirmed the decision, noting that while the Supreme Court has recognized the validity of imposing taxes on greenhouse gas emissions, the method that the State of Baja California had chosen to quantify the tax (based on sales of gasoline, diesel, or gas) encroached upon Congresss exclusive authority to tax the sale of such fuels.

Challenge to the constitutionality of amendments to the rules governing Clean Energy Certificates,"On March 9, 2021, Mexico published amendments to Mexicos Electric Industry Act. One of the amendments established that the allocation of Clean Energy Certificates will no longer be conditioned on ownership or utilities start date of commercial operations. On April 8, 2021, members of the Senates minority filed a constitutionality action challenging the constitutionality of several amendments to the Electric Industry Act, including those that change the rules of operation for Clean Energy Certificates. A constitutionality action is a special procedure in Mexican law that entitles certain state actors, like a 33% congressional minority from either the House of Representatives or the Senate, to petition the Supreme Court for abstract judicial review of laws.

On April 7, 2022, seven out of the eleven Supreme Court Justices decided that the amendments to the Electric Industry Law are unconstitutional. Among other reasonings, the Justices considered that the amendments do not comply with the principle of sustainability in the Mexican electric system, and violate the right to a healthy environment. However, eight votes were required for the law to be declared invalid. Since only seven Justices voted for the unconstitutionality of the law, the Electric Industry Law was declared valid.

Greenpeace France and Others v. TotalEnergies SE and TotalEnergies Electricite et Gaz France,"On March 2nd, 2022, Greenpeace France, Amis de la Terre, Notre Affaire a Tous (ClientEarth supports the case and will be a third-party intervener) filed a request to obtain an injunction and compensation against TotalEnergies SE (the parent company of the TotalEnergies group) and TotalEnergies Electricite et Gaz France (one of the subsidiaries of the group). The case argues that Totals flagship advertising campaign accompanying its rebrand to TotalEnergies misled French consumers, because (i) Totals claims to be aiming for net zero by 2050 and to becoming a major player in the energy transition are false and (ii) the advertising claims promoting the environmental virtues and transition role of gas and biofuels are misleading.

The action is brought on the basis of Articles L.121-1 and ff. of the French Consumer Code (which implement EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive), article 1240 of the French Civil Code, and article L. 142-2 of the Environment Code.
 
The NGOs argue that they have standing to pursue the defendants for unfair commercial practices on the basis of article L. 142-2 of the Environment Code, which sets forth that  the approved organizations referred to in Article L. 141-2 may exercise the rights granted to civil parties in respect of acts directly or indirectly prejudicial to the collective interests that they are intended to defend and constituting an infringement of the legislative provisions relating to the protection of nature and the environment, (...) and having as their object (...) commercial practices and advertising that are misleading or likely to be misleading when such practices or advertising include environmental indications, as well as the texts adopted for their application . 

The NGOs argue that Total's campaign launched on May 29th, 2021 (and still ongoing), aiming to rebrand the company and its activity as environmentally sustainable, has misled and still mislead French consumers. Totals claims on carbon neutrality by 2050 and energy transition, fossil gas and agrofuels are false. Closer scrutiny of the facts reveals that companies behavior is in total opposition to the requirements of the transition to carbon neutrality by 2050. Therefore, this commercial campaign entails a substantial alteration of the economic behavior of the consumer and should be considered as misleading commercial practices within the meaning of articles L.121-2 and L.121-3 of the French Consumer Code. The campaign fulfills all the conditions under articles L. 121-1 ff. of the French Consumer Code (which apply also to environmental claims) because it has a commercial aim and misleads the consumers.

The organizations claim for an injunction to stop the campaign, the publication of the decision, the compensation of the moral damages suffered by the organizations and the repayment of legal fees. 

This case was brought under the French national law implementing the European Union Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. Therefore, the outcome of this case will be relevant to other companies in the EU.  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case challenging an oil and gas major's net-zero claims for greenwashing in Europe (following ACCR's net-zero greenwashing case against Santos in Australia).

Regional Government of Atacama v Ministry of Mining and Other,"In 1979, lithium was declared of national interest in Chile. Since then, only the State of Chile can manage lithium production, which maintains the status of lithium as a strategic mineral. On October 13, 2021, the Government of Chile (through the Ministry of Mining) published a call for applications to increase lithium production. This call intends to facilitate the entry of national and foreign companies in the lithium market, promoting production and supporting the development of new technologies that enable the energy transition and the fight against global warming. Lithium is a key element of the energy transition given the increased demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for supplying the power and transport sectors with renewable energy. The call seeks encompass exploration, exploitation, and commercialization of a total of 400,000 tons of marketable metallic lithium, divided into 5 quotas of 80,000 tons each. 

On January 10, 2022, the regional government of Atacama brought a case against the Ministry of Mining. The complaint questions the bidding process of the lithium production application, which the regional government argues was carried out without public participation and in the absence of any assessment of the activitys potential environmental impacts on the region. The regional government argues that the project will be developed in the Atacama Salt Flats, representing a threat to its biodiversity. Atacama also points out that the project might destroy wetlands, the availability of water, which is already scarce in the area, and the destruction of cultural heritage, as it is a sector of high touristic interest. While the regional government recognizes that the call for lithium bidding responds to international pressure to guarantee an energy transition, it highlights the preliminary step to assess the impacts of the increased lithium mining. The regional authority requests that the contracts are deemed null or, in the alternative, to restart the bidding process and ensure that the regional government is properly consulted. 

The Ministry of Mining argued that the bids have already been awarded to two companies and that the existing contracts refer to the exploration and exploitation of lithium. A constitutional action would not be pertinent at this stage. In the defendants view, the Court should analyze the alleged arbitrariness or illegality of the act at a later stage, once the act of granting the concessions has been completed. The Ministry of Mining further noted that it is up to the successful bidder to obtain the different  permits required for the operation of the lithium plant, for example environmental, water and administrative permits.

"Cosima Rade, et al. v. Baden-Wurttemberg (BaWu)","On December 6, 2021, the youth and young adult plaintiffs Cosima Rade, Hauke Engels, Jonathan Heckert, Judith Scheytt and An Janna Mahendrarajah, supported by environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany), brought a constitutional claim against the state of Baden-Wurttemberg (BaWu) for the inadequacy of its adopted and amended climate law. The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) to call on the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway, to comply with the remaining CO2 budget and adopt sufficient instruments to achieve and verify the climate protection targets set by the Paris Agreement.

The 2013 BaWu Climate Protection Act was amended on October 11, 2021, replacing GHG reductions of 90% by 2050, with climate neutrality by 2040 and emissions reductions of 65% by 2030. However, plaintiffs argued that the BaWu Protection Act failed to lay down a sufficiently clear and binding legal framework for the implementation of the strategy and goals. Thereby, much of the implementation was left to the executive, which according to plaintiffs, may be guided by political interests. Moreover, plaintiffs highlighted the lack of measurable, intermittent goals.  

The plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Courts decision in (<a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>), following which Germany adjusted its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argued that codification of a constitutional and legally binding reduction path is also required at the state level, as states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence. Plaintiffs argued that the BaWu law falls short of these constitutional requirements. Plaintiffs asserted a violation by the state of its duty to protect and invoked their constitutional rights, to defend themselves against considerable future restrictions on their freedoms which  in view of rapidly progressing climate change  are to be considered inevitable and are already reflected in the insufficient action by the BaWu legislature.

On January 18, 2022, the First Senate of the Federal Constitutional Court did not admit the eleven complaints for adjudication, on the basis of a lack of adequate prospects. Widely in alignment with its decision in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, the Court acknowledged that greenhouse gas reduction burdens cannot be unilaterally offloaded onto the future.

Germany) is a prerequisite for such an effect. Rather it is the federal German legislature that is bound by the CO2 budget, but has a prerogative with respect to its implementation.

"Matteo Feind, et al. v. Niedersachsen","On December 6, 2021, the youth and young adult plaintiffs Matteo Feind, Jennifer Zauter, Emily Karius, Steven Haseloh and Linus Steinmetz, supported by environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany), brought a constitutional claim against the state of Lower Saxony for the inadequacy of its adopted climate law. The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) to call on the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway, to comply with the remaining CO2 budget and adopt sufficient instruments to achieve and verify the climate protection targets set by the Paris Agreement.

According to plaintiffs, the states 2020 Climate Protection Act (NKlimaG) goals for the years 2030 (emissions reductions of 55%) and 2050 (climate neutrality), failed to set intermittent goals and a legal structure for monitoring and enforcement. Furthermore, plaintiffs argued that the NKlimaGs climate neutrality goal for 2050 violated federal law, where climate neutrality was stipulated for 2045. 

The plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Courts decision in (Neubauer v. Germany), following which Germany adjusted its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argued that codification of a constitutional and legally binding reduction path is also required at the state level, as states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Baden-Wurttemberg (BaWu),"On November 8, 2021, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) brought a claim against the state of Baden-Wurttemberg (BaWu) asking the Higher Administrative Court of BaWu to order the BaWu government to adopt an integrated energy and climate protection plan to: (i) reduce greenhouse gas emissions by more than 65% by 2030 (as compared to 1990 levels) and (ii) reach carbon neutrality by 2040. 

The states climate protection law (KSG BW), adopted in 2013 and amended in 2021, stipulates that in 2020 and every five years thereafter, the state government shall decide an integrated energy and climate protection concept, which sets out essential objectives, strategies and measures for meeting the overall climate protection goals. This concept is to be decided on the basis of legally mandated monitoring reports and following consultations with civil society associations and federations. Plaintiff complaints that to date, no such integrated energy and climate protection concept exists, even though the KSG BW was amended in 2021. As a result, plaintiff argues, the state is in violation of its own Climate Protection Act.

"Steinmetz, et al. v. Germany","On January 24, 2022, a group of German minors and young adults, supported by environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH, Environmental Action Germany) filed a constitutional challenge to Germany's updated Federal Climate Protection Act (Bundesklimaschutzgesetz or KSG). Claimants argue that the KSG's amended GHG emissions reduction paths are insufficient in light of Germanys constitutional and international legal obligations.   

This constitutional challenge builds on the Constitutional Courts order in <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/"">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, where the Court found in favor of a group of youths, striking down parts of the KSG as incompatible with fundamental rights for failing to set sufficient emissions reduction pathways. For the first time in its jurisprudence, the Court stated that the fundamental rights - as intertemporal guarantees of freedom - afford protection against the greenhouse gas reduction burdens imposed by Art. 20a of the Basic Law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future."" Consequently, the Constitutional Court ordered the federal German legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets. In response to the decision, the federal lawmakers passed a bill approving an adapted KSG, which has been in effect since August 31, 2021. It raised the reduction target for 2030 from 55% to 65% (as compared to 1990 levels). It also updated the reduction path for the years 2031-2040, and elaborated on the legislative involvement in the determination of the individual sector budgets from 2031 onwards. Lastly, the target year for achieving carbon neutrality was brought forward from 2050 to 2045. 

Relying on a new factual basis and scientific updates, claimants argue that the amended KSG and its reduction targets are insufficient to protect their fundamental rights: 

In August 2021, the IPCCC released the first part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6WGI), on the scientific basis of climate change. The report details how the 1.5C limit may be surpassed in roughly 10 years. In the Report, the IPCC also refined previous calculations on residual budgets, directly transferrable onto Germanys remaining budget. Beyond these developments in international climate science, claimants also invoked the Glasgow Climate Pact. In this joint final declaration of COP26, the UNFCCCs contracting parties agreed to significantly strengthen the 1.5C target, which includes drastic emissions reductions before the end of the decade. 

Claimants argue that the new reduction path continues to infringe on their fundamental rights, as it will use up large parts of Germanys remaining CO2 budget, as determined in accordance with Article 20a of the Basic Law. Rather, claimants argue, both reduction paths, i.e., from 2021-2030, and after 2030 exceed the budget limits and put Germany way above the Paris and/or Glasgow targets. In addition, claimants argue that the risk of considerable impairments of their fundamental rights is further increased by the lack of clear obligations on, and coordinated efforts across the federal states. As a result, the federal states have very differing and at times insufficient climate protection policies. Claimants ask the Constitutional Court to declare parts of the amended KSG unconstitutional and to order the federal legislature to re-regulate the reduction pathway in light of new scientific constraints, and to make provision for the distribution of the reduction burden across the federal states.

"Kaiser, et al. v. Volkswagen AG","On November 8, 2021, three claimants associated with Greenpeace Germany and Fridays for Future Germany filed an action against Volkswagen AG (VW) in the Regional Court of Braunschweig for not yet having clearly and irreversibly committed to phase out the sale of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles with internal combustion engines (ICE) by 2030. 

The claimants argue that by failing to do so, the automaker is violating the fundamental right to climate protection and impinging upon the rights and freedoms of future generations, as phase out would be necessary for the company to adhere to its allocated carbon budget. The claim is grounded in the Paris Agreement and German Tort Law. The claimants rely on the earlier decision by the Federal Constitutional Court (BVerfG) on the German Climate Protection Act, where the Court accepted that Germany has a limited total CO2 emissions budget remaining at its disposal (Neubauer v. Germany). The action filed against VW is one of the first civil proceedings based on this decision.

The claimants ask the court to order VW: (i) to stop placing and to have ceased placement of new ICE passenger cars and light commercial vehicles on the market after December 31, 2029; (ii) to take appropriate measures to ensure that the annual aggregated CO2 emissions (Scope 1, 2 and 3) by VW and its subsidiaries, resulting from the development, production and distribution of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles are reduced by at least 65% by 2030 (compared to 2018 levels), and, at a minimum, to keep them below this level; (iii) to take appropriate measures to ensure that throughout the Volkswagen Group, i.e. across all fully consolidated subsidiaries and brands involved in the development, production and sale of passenger cars, light commercial vehicles and passenger car services, at most 25% of the total number of passenger cars and light commercial vehicles put into circulation between 2021 and the end of 2029 are ICE vehicles; and (iv) to ensure that VW exercises its legal and actual influence in its joint ventures (not fully consolidated shareholdings) in such a way that the goals described in (i), (ii) and (iii) are met.

DS-412: Canada  Certain Measures Affecting the Renewable Energy Generation Sector,"Complainant:	Japan
Respondent:	Canada
Third Parties:	Australia; Brazil; China; El Salvador; European Union; Honduras; India; Saudi Arabia, Kingdom of; Korea, Republic of; Mexico; Norway; Chinese Taipei; United States

In 2009, the Canadian province of Ontario approved a feed-in tariff (FIT) scheme under the Green Energy and Green Economy Act. Under this statute, electricity produced from renewable energy was awarded a guaranteed price per kilowatt hour (kWh) of electricity delivered into the Ontario electricity system under 20-year or 40-year contracts. Such scheme also included a mandatory percentage of local content requirements (LCRs), ranging from 25% to 60%. This entails that a certain amount of components had to be sourced from local enterprises.

Following the adoption of this legislation, on September 13, 2010, Japan filed a request for consultations, claiming that the measures implemented by the State of Ontario to promote electricity from renewable energy sources were inconsistent with Canadas obligation under:
(a)	Articles III:4 and III:5 of the GATT 1994, as they were laws, regulations or requirements affecting the internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution, or use of equipment for renewable energy generation facilities that accord less favorable treatment to imported equipment than that accorded to like products originating in Ontario;
(b)	Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement, as they appeared to be trade-related investment measures that are inconsistent with the provisions of Article III of the GATT 1994; and
(c)	Articles 3.1(b) and 3.2 of the SCM Agreement, as they appeared to be a subsidy granted under the measures listed above within the meaning of Article 1.1 of the SCM Agreement, because there would be a financial contribution or a form of income or price support, and a benefit would thereby be conferred.

The Canadian government defended the measures at stake, arguing that they were covered by the government procurement exception under Article III:8(a) GATT, as the laws and requirements that create and implement the FIT Program are laws and requirements that govern the procurement of renewable electricity for the governmental purpose of securing electricity supply for Ontario consumers from clean sources, and not with a view to commercial resale.

On December 19, 2012, the Panel issued its report on the case, upholding Japan's claims under Article 2.1 of the TRIMs Agreement and Article III:4 of the GATT 1994. In particular, the Panel found that the incentives scheme represented investment measures covered by Article 1 TRIMs Agreement, and they were trade-related in the sense that the Minimum Required Domestic Content Level included in Ontarios scheme by definition favors the use of domestic products over imported products, and therefore affects trade. On these grounds, the Panel ruled that the FIT program, to the extent that it features a LCR that is inconsistent with Article III:4 GATT, also integrates a TRIM inconsistent with Article 2.1 TRIMs Agreement. Moreover, the Panel rejected Canadas exception under Article III:8(a) GATT, according to which the discriminatory measures were justified as government procurement. Instead, the Panel found that renewably generated electricity was indeed subsidized by Ontario with a view to commercial resale, as it was commercialized through the exact same channels as all other generating sources, so that it was in competition with private-sector electricity retailers. Nevertheless, the Panel rejected the complaint that had been raised under the SCM Agreement, finding that it was not possible to establish that the incentives provided by the State of Ontario constitute a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) SCM Agreement. In the Panels reasoning, this is due to the fact that, in practice, renewable electricity would not be able to compete against electricity from conventional sources without the governmental incentives. Therefore, the Panel concluded that due to the lack of a comparable market standard, the program could not be legally characterized as a subsidy.

On May 6, 2013, the Appellate Body issued its report on the case, which provided a partially different reasoning on some of the issues, while not determining substantial changes in the outcome of the case. In particular, the Appellate Bodys analysis focused on the applicability of the government procurement exception under Article III:8(a) GATT and on the existence of a prohibited or actionable subsidy under the SCM Agreement. With regard to the former issue, the Appellate Body provided a different interpretation than the Panel, to the extent that it recognized that the product subject to the local content requirements was renewable energy generation equipment, yet the product purchased by the Government of Ontario under the FIT Program is electricity. On this basis, the Appellate Body found that the lack of a direct competitive relationship between the two products electricity and generation equipment was determinant to exclude the applicability of the exception under Article III:8(a) GATT. With regard to the existence of a subsidy covered by the SCM Agreement, the Appellate Body argued that the benefit analysis should have been conducted by comparing Ontarios FIT scheme with previous renewable energy support policies adopted by the Ontarios government, rather than comparing it with conventional energy sources. However, it concluded that, given the lack of factual findings in the Panels report, and due to the procedural restraints under Article 17.6 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU), it could not complete the analysis and determine whether the challenged measures confer a benefit within the meaning of Article 1.1(b) of the SCM Agreement and whether they constitute a prohibited subsidy inconsistent with Articles 3.1(b) and Article 3.2 of the SCM Agreement.",Decided,['World Trade Organization>WTO Dispute Settlement Body'],['Suits against governments>Trade and Investment>Climate-justified measures'],"['Agreement on Trade-Related Investment Measures (TRIMs Agreement)', 'Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures (SCM Agreement)', 'General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994']",Whether Canadas feed-in tariff program for electricity produced from renewable energy represents a violation of the national treatment provisions due to its local content requirements and whether it represents a prohibited subsidy.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ds-412-canada-certain-measures-affecting-the-renewable-energy-generation-sector/
Minister of Environment v. PT Kalista Alam,"On November 8, 2012, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment (the MoEF) filed a tort-based lawsuit against a corporation, PT Kalista Alam, for damage caused by land clearing. The lawsuit is based on Articles 88 Environmental Protection and Management Act (the 2009 EPMA) and article 1365 of Indonesian Civil Code. The Plaintiff argued that the defendant had drained and burned the peatland which caused fires inside the concession areas. The plaintiff also argued that the defendant failed to provide prevention tools to avoid fires in the concession. The MoEF then explained forestry regulations in Indonesia obliging every license holder to provide fires control measuresin which the defendant considered violating its obligations. The MoEF claimed that fires inside the concession had caused significant environmental damages. These damages comprise of ecological damage, damage to biodiversity and carbon release, and economic losses due to land degradation. Accordingly, the MoEF sought compensation of IDR 115 billion and restoration costs amounting to IDR 250 billion. 

For the carbon losses, the MoEF stated two type of climate damages caused by the defendant. Firstly, the fires inside the concession areas had released 13,500 tC into the atmosphere. The MoEF set that the carbon release cost is IDR 90,000 per ton which costs the defendant of IDR 1.2 billion. Secondly, the MoEF claimed that the fires had also reduced the ability to absorb CO2 of the peatland. A total of IDR 425.3 million was required to repair the losses. 

On January 8, 2014, the district court granted half of the plaintiffs claim against the defendant. Nonetheless, the district court decided that the defendants had violated the regulations and were liable for all environmental losses. On August 15, 2014, the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court decision. On August 28, 2015, the Supreme Court upheld the district court decision and refused a cassation from the defendant. On February 10, 2017, the defendant filed request for an extraordinary review (peninjauan kembali) and brought new evidence. The defendant argued that judges on lower court based their judgment with inadmissible evidence as regulated in Article 1866 of Indonesia Civil Code. On April 18, 2017, the Supreme Court once again rejected the request (peninjauan kembali) and upheld the lower court ruling.",Decided,['Indonesia>Meulaboh District Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage']","['Indonesia>Indonesia Civil Code', 'Indonesia>Environmental Law No.32 of 2009']",Restoration for climate damage caused by palm plantation land clearing.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/minister-of-environment-v-pt-kalista-alam/
Ministry of Environment and Forestry v. PT Bumi Mekar Hijau,"On February 3, 2015, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MoEF) filed a tort-based lawsuit against PT Bumi Mekar Hijau for intentionally causing fires to the peatlands. The MoEF argued that the defendant had intentionally burn the peatlands area to clear the land for timber planting purposes. Thus, the MoEF requested the court to declare that defendant liable for damages amounting to IDR 5.299 trillion and restoration costs for IDR 2.687 trillion. With damages and restoration cost amounting almost to IDR 8 trillion, this lawsuit is ranked among the highest damages in Indonesian forest fires litigation.

Ministry of Environment and Forestry v. PT Merbau Pelelawan Lestari,"On September 2013, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) filed a tort-based lawsuit against a corporation, PT Merbau Pelelawan Lestari, for the release of GHGs emissions. The plaintiffs argued that the defendant's illegal logging had impaired the forests carbon sink capacity. The plaintiff sought compensation for the cost of restoring the damaged forest, specifically its carbon sequestration function. The damage amounted to IDR 240 billion (approximately US$17.2 million) for the total affected area of 7,463 hectares. The defendant argued that it had not carried out any illegal logging and stated that the plaintiff should have given the company administrative sanctions for illegal logging prior to initiating the lawsuit.

Yayasan Wahana Lingkungan Hidup Indonesia v. Governor of Bali and others,"In 2012, an environmental organization, Wahana Lingkungan Hidup, filed a lawsuit against the Governor of Bali for issuing a permit to establish tourist accommodation facilities in a mangrove ecosystem area, which is included in a forest park area (Taman Hutan Raya) which is supposed to be excluded from possible commercial use. The plaintiff argued that the issuance of the permit was against the 2009 EPMA and Government Regulation No. 36 of 2010 on Nature Tourism Business in Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Grand Forest Parks and Nature Tourism Parks because it did not involve the community in the permit application process and had the potential to cause damage to the mangrove ecosystem. The plaintiff argued that the logging of mangrove trees in the permit area can hinder the mangroves function in mitigating climate change since mangrove forests have a much greater ability to absorb CO2 than other tropical land forests.

In response, the defendant argued that the permit was granted to provide an opportunity for a third party to pursue natural tourism within the forest park area to protect and preserve the forest area from potential damage due to garbage and mud. The granting of permits has received technical recommendations from the Natural Resource Conservation Center (Balai Konservasi Sumber Daya Alam).

On August 1, 2013, the Administrative Court of Denpasar ruled in favor of the plaintiff and ordered the cancellation of the permit by the Governor of Bali. On November 28, 2013, the decision was annulled by the Court of Appeal. On May, 2014 the Supreme Court confirmed the annulment of the decision, because the activities in the mangrove area were only at the planning stage, and there had been no actual damage. The courts did not consider climate change in their decisions.

Herrera Carrion et al. v. Ministry of the Environment et al. (Caso Mecheros),"On February 18, 2020, a group of nine girls from the provinces of Sucumbios and Orellana filed a constitutional injunction (accion de proteccion) against the government of Ecuador. In their lawsuit, plaintiffs claimed that gas flaring is unlawful, although it can be authorised by exception, and that despite this, the State has made it a common practice, which constitutes a violation of the rights to health, water and food sovereignty, the right to a healthy environment and, the rights of Nature. They furthermore argued that pollution of gas flaring causes serious impacts on the environment and on people's health, damage to biodiversity and the cycles of nature, and contributes to climate change. Plaintiffs requested, inter alia, the annulment of all gas flaring authorizations, the immediate elimination of all flaring towers located in various areas of the Amazon where there is oil activity, and the prohibition of new oil-related flares in the region.

On May 7, 2020, the Court of first instance dismissed the constitutional action due to lack of evidence that justifies the alleged constitutional rights violation. As a response, plaintiffs filed an appeal before the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios. 

On July 29, 2021, the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbio accepted the appeal and declared that ""the Ecuadorian State has ignored the right of the plaintiffs to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment and their right to health by promoting polluting activities, and by refusing to use environmentally clean and energy-efficient technologies."" The Court indicated that the authorizations for gas flaring, as an activity associated with hydrocarbon production carried out by the Ecuadorian State, disregards various international commitments made by Ecuador in environmental matters, among the most important: Ecuador's Nationally Determined Contributions, carried out during the COP 21 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. As a result, the Court ordered to update the plan for the gradual and progressive elimination of the gas flares, with those located in places close to the populated centers being the first to be removed, for which a period of 18 months is granted; with respect to the other gas flares, they should proceed to their progressive elimination until December 2030. In addition, the Ministry of Energy and Non-Renewable Natural Resources may grant authorizations for new clean technologies located away from populated centers.",Decided,"['Ecuador>Family, Women, and Children Judicial Unit of Lago Agrio in the Sucumbios Province', 'Ecuador>Multicompetent Chamber of the Provincial Court of Justice of Sucumbios']","['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Youth/Children', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment']","['American Convention on Human Rights>San Salvador Protocol', 'Ecuador>Organic Environmental Code', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",Whether gas flaring resulting from States authorization produces the violation of human rights violations of a group of nine children.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/herrera-carrion-et-al-v-ministry-of-the-environment-et-al-caso-mecheros/
"Baihua Caiga et. al., v. PetroOriental S.A.","On December 10, 2020, Juana Mintare Baihua Caiga, Pego Enomenga Enomenga, and Juan Pablo Enomenga, as members of the Waorani Nation located in the Miwaguno community, alongside the NGOs Accion Ecologica, Union de Afectados y Afectadas por las Operaciones de Texaco (UDAPT), and the International Federation of Human Rights (FIDH), filed a constitutional injunction called accion de proteccion against the Chinese oil company PetroOriental S.A. The constitutional lawsuit was filed before a Judicial Unit in the canton of Francisco de Orellana, in the Amazon region.

The plaintiffs argued that the gas flaring emanating from an oil concession operated by PetroOriental S.A. is an act that causes constitutional rights violations, specifically because it emits greenhouse gases (GHG) that contribute to climate change. Applicants claimed that climate change produces irregular and unpredictable floods, disturbance in the natural cycles of plants, loss of ancestral knowledge, droughts and other climatic phenomena, all of which have human rights implications. Based on provisions from the Ecuadorian Constitution, national environmental law, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, and case law from the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, applicants stressed that the defendant had violated several human rights. These included (i) the rights of nature as GHG emissions altered the carbon cycle, (ii) the right to enjoy a healthy and ecologically balanced environment as climate change breaks down the ecological balance, (iii) the right to food because applicants have seen their food security and food sovereignty diminished, (iv) the right to water because droughts and floods are becoming more extreme and unpredictable, limiting access, quality, quantity and availability of water, (v) the right to health because the scarcity of food and traditional medicines affects the applicants wellbeing, (vi) the right to land and territory because the applicants ability to enjoy natural resources through ancestral practices has been limited, (vii) and the right to life and a dignified life because the applicants existence is threatened, and the minimum conditions to continue with their life projects are not met.
The plaintiffs requested that the court (i) declares that the constitutional rights mentioned were infringed, (ii) orders the prohibition of gas flaring where the defendant operates; and (iii) orders the defendant reparations by financing projects designed by the community to adapt to climate impacts in their territory.

On July 15, 2021, judge Cuacal Galarraga did not admit the constitutional action since the plaintiffs had not sufficiently demonstrated how the actions of the defendant violate the rights of nature or any constitutional right deriving therefrom.",Decided,"['Ecuador>Family, Women, and Children Judicial Unit from Francisco de Orellana Canton']","['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']","['American Convention on Human Rights>San Salvador Protocol', 'United Nations Declaration on Indigenous Peoples Rights', 'ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169', 'Ecuador>Organic Law on Jurisdictional Guarantees and Constitutional Control', 'Ecuador>Constitution', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",Whether gas flaring resulting from a private companys oil extraction contributes to climate change and associated violations of the rights of nature and the rights of indigenous peoples living in the vicinity of the operations site.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/baihua-caiga-et-al-v-petrooriental-sa/

All Aboard Aotearoa v Auckland Transport,"In June 2021, the Planning Committee of Auckland Council, acting on the recommendation of Aucklands Regional Transport Committee (RTC), adopted the Regional Land Transport Plan 2021 (RLTP). Under the RLTP, Aucklands transport emissions are expected to increase 6% between 2016 and 2031, and vehicle kilometers traveled per capita are not expected to decrease. All Aboard Aotearoa (AAA), an NGO, brought an action against the three local government bodies which had proposed, recommended, and adopted the RLTP.

First, AAA alleged that the decision of the RTC to recommend the RLTP was unlawful because the Committee relied on incorrect advice; that the RLTP was inconsistent with New Zealands Land Transport Management Act 2003 (which requires a safe land transport system in the public interest); and that it was inconsistent with New Zealands national Government Policy Statement on Land Transport 2021 (GPS), which contains a strategic priority of transforming to a low carbon transport system. Secondly, AAA challenged the decision of Auckland Councils Planning Committee to approve the RLTP on the basis that the Council had relied on flawed advice; had failed to consider the requirements of New Zealands Local Government Act 2002 (LGA), which requires consideration of the interests of future communities; and had failed to identify that the RLTP was inconsistent with Auckland Councils Climate Emergency Declaration. Third, AAA alleged that the Board of Auckland Transport  the council-controlled organization which had proposed the RLTP  had acted unlawfully because it was not properly informed; and had acted contrary to its statutory purpose (which required it to contribute to an effective, efficient, and safe Auckland land transport system in the public interest).

In July 2022, the Court rejected the challenges against the decisions of all three agencies. First, it found that the RTC had not acted contrary to the purposes of the LTMA. This was because the LTMA made no explicit reference to social, economic, cultural or environmental wellbeing, and that the statute had actually been amended to remove such factors. Next, the Court found that the RTC had not acted inconsistently with the GPS. Although climate change was a strategic priority reflected in the GPS, it did not have primacy over other grounds, such as safety, better travel options, and improving freight connections. The RTC was entitled to balance climate considerations against other factors. The Court also rejected procedural challenges related to the RTCs decision to recommend the RLTP for adoption. The Court also dismissed claims that the Auckland Council Planning Committee had acted unlawfully. It found that the Planning Committees role in the adoption of the RLTP was a limited non-statutory process to which its obligations und er the LGA did not apply. Finally, the Court dismissed the claim against the Board of Auckland Transport on the same basis as it had dismissed the claim against the RTC.

Associacao Brasileira dos Membros do Ministerio Publico de Meio Ambiente vs. Ministro de Estado do Meio Ambiente ADPF 814,"On March 19, 2020, ABRAMPA (Brazilian Association of Members of the Public Ministry of the Environment), a non-profit civil association, filed the Claim for Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF) in light of Federal Decree 10.143/2019 and Ministry of the Environment (MMA) Ordinance 575/2020, to suspend the effects of the change in the composition of the Management Committee of the National Climate Change Fund (Climate Fund) and its deliberative procedure, in view of the provisions of articles 1; 5th, Inc. I and XXXVI; 14; 37; 60, 4 and inc. I; 193 and 225 of the Federal Constitution.

The proponents allege that such changes reduced the transparency of the deliberative process of the collegiate body and reduced its representativeness, violating the federative, democratic and popular participation principles. The participation of States and Municipalities in the committee was eliminated. The participation of civil society interested in combating climate change was also considerably reduced, since representatives of the scientific community, non-governmental organizations working on the climate issue, urban and rural workers, family farming, and traditional communities. On the other hand, the participation of economic sectors that are not necessarily committed to the climate agenda was expanded, since their profitable activity is still heavily based, precisely, on the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG) that cause climate change.

The lack of representativeness of the new composition of the body and the absence of members specialized in the climate issue and directly interested in the fight against climate change have diverted the Management Committee from achieving its institutional purpose. So much so that the Fund's resources have been inappropriately invested since 2020.

The Climate Fund is one of the instruments of the National Policy on Climate Change and was created by Law 12114 on 12/09/2009, regulated by Decree 7343 of 10/26/2010, and currently governed by Decree 10143 of 11/28 /2019. It consists of an accounting fund, linked to the Ministry of the Environment with the purpose of guaranteeing resources to support projects or studies and financing of ventures that have the objective of mitigating climate change. The Management Committee of the National Fund on Climate Change was established by administrative ordinance of the Ministry of the Environment in 2020 (Ordinance number 515/2020) and, among other regulations, regulates the composition of the management staff, origin of their appointment and deliberative rules of their decisions.

Both devices have the function of disciplining the execution of Law No. 12,114/2009, which created the Climate Fund. Therefore, both Decree 10.143/2019 and Ordinance No. 515/2020 are the subject of ADPF 814, as their recent changes threaten the right to an ecologically balanced environment (art. 225 of the CF). Other fundamental precepts violated according to the authors were direct popular participation (art. 1, sole paragraph, 14 and 193, sole paragraph of the CF); the federative principle (art. 1, caput of the CF); in the principle of the prohibition of institutional setback (which arises from the rights enshrined in article 1, caput and item III; article 5, item XXXVI and  o; and article 60,  4, IV of the CF); the right to equality (art. 5, item I, of the CF); and the principles of transparency and efficiency of Public Administration (art. 37, caput of the CF).

In April 2021, Minister Gilmar Mendes did not acknowledge the lawsuit due to the illegitimacy of ABRAMPA to propose an Action of Claim for Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept, based on Law no. 9,882/99 that in its art. 1, sole paragraph, I, and art. 4, 1, regulates art. 103, 1, of the Federal Constitution.

On appeal, the acknowledgement of the lawsuit was again denied in May 2021 in a session chaired by Minister Luiz Fux.

Public Ministry of the State of Sao Paulo v. United Airlines and Others (Airline Companies Case),"This is a Public Civil Action filed by the Public Ministry of the State of Sao Paulo (MPSP) against the company KLM - Cia Real Ho Holanda de Aviacao for alleged environmental damage resulting from commercial activities carried out by the defendant at Sao Paulo International Airport, in Cumbica, Garulhos, through the landing and take-off of their aircraft. 

The company is required to remediate or provide compensation for environmental damage, especially with regard to the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). The initial petition requests an obligation of forest restoration in an area in the same hydrographic basin in sufficient quantity to fully absorb the emissions of GHGs and other pollutants resulting from the activity. In response, the company alleged that the applicant filed 35 actions identical to the present one and that the Sao Paulo State Court of Justice (TJSP), by design, recognized the ineptitude of 26 of the initial petitions and expressed the merits of the action in only one of the cases, case 224.01.2010.082070-8, proposed against EMIRATES AIRLINES, having dismissed the remaining requests. 

The company argued (i) its passive illegitimacy, given that it performs its activity in accordance with the determinations of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), and cannot be held responsible for complying with what is authorized and imposed by the Public Power; and (ii) legal impossibility of the request since there would be no illegal activity practiced by the Defendant. In the first instance, the Court understood that the Defendant had governmental authorization for the exercise of certain routes and the emissions resulting from the normal exercise of said activity would already be included in the scope of that authorization. On appeal before the TJSP (Appeal 0082072-08.2010.8.26.0224), the MPSP, on the merits, again requested the mitigation and repair of the environmental damage caused by the defendant. Subsequently, the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) joined the action requesting the intervention as a third party and the remittance of the case to the federal court. 

A decision was handed down in the TJSP rejecting the preliminary presented by the MPSP and, in view of the ANAC's manifestation, it decided to refer the case to the Federal Regional Court of the 3rd Region (TRF-3). In this sense, it should be noted that the present action was initially filed in the State Court of Sao Paulo (TJSP), but was later referred to the Federal Court, due to the request for intervention by ANAC. The action was registered in the TRF-3 under the Civil Appeal number 0046991-68.2012.4.03.9999. Within the scope of the appeal, the TRF-3 decided to dismiss it, following the understanding of the court of origin, which understood that there was an environmental licensing process already carried out for Guarulhos Airport and authorization for the landing and take-off activity drawn up by ANAC . From this ruling, the MPSP filed a Special Appeal (REsp 1,856,031/SP) with the STJ, where there was a monocratic decision that followed the position of the court of origin in order to emphasize the specific regulation of the activity by ANAC and its efforts in terms of regarding the measurement and mitigation of emissions by the airline industry. It was understood that there would be no need to talk about an illicit act practiced by the business company (or even pollution), with the MPSP intending to impose an unforeseen regulation. After the decision, the REsp was written off to the court of origin. 

The present case is one among other similar ones proposed by the MPSP against more than 30 airlines that operated at Sao Paulo International Airport. The Public Prosecutor of Sao Paulo brought a group of several cases seeking to compel airlines that make use of the region's international airport to offset their emissions. The court consolidated the cases against the various defendants: United Airlines, TAAG Linhas Aereas de Angola, Delta Airlines, Cia. Mexicana, Emirates Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas, and South African Airways. The means of offset requested was support for reforestation in the region. The court rejected the suits against several of the airlines on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims.",Decided,"['Brazil>Superior Court of Justice', 'Brazil>Regional Federal Court, 3rd Region']","['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>GHG emissions reduction']","['Brazil>National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)', 'Brazil>National Environmental Policy Act (Law No. 6.938 of 1981)', 'Brazil>Constitution of 1988']",Whether airlines should remediate climate damage done during takeoff/landing given governmental authorization to perform such activities. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-ministry-of-the-state-of-sao-paulo-v-klm/
Saonu and Morobe Provincial Government v. Minster for Environment and Conservation and Climate Change and Others,"On December 18, 2020, the Managing Director of the Conservation and Environmental Protection Authority issued an environmental permit for the Wafi-Golpu Mining Project as a precondition for the issuance of a special mining lease. On XX, the plaintiffs - the Morobe Provincial Government on its own behalf and on behalf of the people of Morobe - applied for a stay of the permit arguing that there was no proper review and consultation as required in the constitution and that the decisions were unreasonable as they would create irreparable environmental damages. The defendants argued for a dismissal of the application for stay. 

On September 20, 2021, the judge granted the application for stay. The judge held that the plaintiffs and other members of the public were denied natural justice as the Minister failed to provide fully the information required and in easily understandable language or incorporate the matters raised in consultations or review meetings. The defendants failed to consider the climate change goals that informed the adoption of the Environment Act when issuing the permit. There was a risk of irreparable damage as the defendants failed to demonstrate how the environmental impact assessment and the permit meet the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, the permit was granted for 50 years, 20 years more than the estimate life of a mine of 30 years. Noting the global impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, the judge noted that the parties did not provide any information on whether the environmental impact assessment factors levels of CO2 emissions and impacts on local and global environment and proposed measures to minimize such emissions. As part of an EIA analysis, the court noted that the assessment should include a question on ""What  climate  change  related  risks  have  been  identified  and  what adaption and mitigation programs if any have been built into the EIS and  the  deep sea tailings placement (DSTP)  and  how  will  that  be  monitored  and  reviewed  and enforced?""

Careme v. France,"The application was introduced by the former mayor of the city of Grande-Synthe in France. The applicant is represented by Ms Corinne Lepage, former Minister of the Environment, former MEP and candidate for the presidential elections in 2002. In 2019 the municipality of Grande-Synthe, which is located in an area considered at very high risk of exposure to climate risks, and the applicant, acting in his capacity of Grande-Synthe Mayor and of a private resident, asked the Council of State to cancel the Government's refusal to take additional measures to meet the Paris Agreement objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% by 2030. The cities of Paris and Grenoble, as well as several environmental protection associations have intervened in the procedure. In its first decision, dated 19 November 2020, the Council of State declared the application admissible insofar as it was introduced by the municipality of Grande-Synthe and allowed the interventions of Paris, Grenoble and eNGOs. The court rejected, however, the application insofar as it was brought by the applicant, on the grounds that he did not show any interest in the case since his claims were limited to the argument that, as an individual, his home was situated in an area likely to be subject to flooding by 2040.

On July 1, 2021 the Council of State ruled on the merits, finding for the claimants. It observed that the drop in emissions in 2019 was too small and that it was not significant in 2020 because the economic activity had been reduced by the health crisis. It also held that adherence to the trajectory, which provides for a 12% drop in emissions for the period 2024-2028, did not appear to be achievable unless new measures were not quickly adopted. The Council of State therefore ordered the Government to take additional measures by March 31, 2022 to achieve the goal of reducing GHG emissions by 40% by 2030 (see <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/commune-de-grande-synthe-v-france/"">Commune de Grande-Synthe v. France</a>). 

Relying on Article 8 of the ECHR, the applicant complains that the Council of State erred in rejecting his action on the ground that he had no interest in the proceedings, even though he was clearly exposed to climate risk caused by insufficient government action. He further argues that the authorities' failure to act constitutes a violation of their obligation to protect the right to private and family life, within the meaning of Article 8 and to guarantee the right to life, within the meaning of article 2.

Uricchio v. Italy and 32 other States,"On March 3, 2021, Italian youth filed a complaint with the European Court of Human Rights against 33 countries. The applicant is an 18-year-old woman living in a small town in southern Italy (Matera) which is prone to floods. She claims to suffer from allergies (skin rush) and psychological distress due to global warming (states of anxiety caused by the inability to go out during the day and, more generally, by concerns about the future and the possibility of continuing to live there due to global warming), which is to be manifested in extraordinarily high temperatures in summer and severe flooding. She lives in a flood zone (Matera).

Relying on Articles 2, 8, 13 and 14, she complains that the 33 States parties to the Convention which are also parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement (including Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Austria, Norway and France) have not taken sufficient measures to implement the latter. She complains about a violation: (i) of the positive obligations of States under Articles 2 and 8 to protect the environment; (ii) of Article 14, since the harmful effects of global warming would hit the younger generations harder; (iii) of article 13, alleging that the domestic remedies would not be effective since she would be forced to lodge a complaint in the courts of 33 States, a burden which it would be impossible for her to bear because of her young age and limited financial resources.

Kang et al. v. KSURE and KEXIM,"On March 23, 2022, one Korean national and three Australian nationals, who are members of the indigenous community in the Tiwi Islands, Northern Territory, brought a claim against the Korea Trade Insurance Corporation, and Korea Export Import Bank, Korean public financial institutions that are functioning as export credit agencies planning to provide financial support to the development project for the Barossa fossil gas reserve off the coast of Northern Territory, Australia, near the Tiwi Islands (Barossa Gas Project). The Barossa Gas Project is being developed by SK E&S (Korea), Santos (Australia) and JERA (Japan). SK E&S purchased 37.5% of the stake in the project in June 2012, reached a final investment decision in March 2021, and applied for export credit guarantee to the defendants. The plaintiffs are seeking preliminary injunction against the defendants not to provide any financial support in relation to the Barossa Gas Project. 

The plaintiffs argued that the project will cause significant environmental harm due to (i) 15Mt p.a. of CO2 emission throughout the entire life cycle of the fossil gas produced and consumed (ii) environmental harm to the marine ecosystem impacting the endangered sea turtle species and the livelihood of the indigenous communities. Plaintiffs also argued that the project has significant legal risk as (i) the developer companies have not completed the requisite consultation process with the indigenous communities and due to (ii) potential dispute over the control of the gas field with Indonesia as it is located within the Indonesian EEZ. Plaintiffs further argued that the project has significant financial risk as (i) development of new fossil gas wells are incompatible with the climate goals under the Paris Agreement (ii) the demand for fossil gas is expected to fall 55% by 2050 according to the IEA projection of the 2050 Net Zero scenario, and (iii) CCS technologies are not mature enough to guarantee reliable capture and storage of the CO2 emissions, creating serious risk of cost overrun.  The claim is based on the environmental rights stipulated under Art. 35 of the Korean Constitution and property rights of the indigenous individuals living in the Tiwi Islands. Plaintiffs also invoked Art. 100 of the National Finance Act, which permits citizens to demand corrective measures against unlawful spending of public funds.",Pending,['South Korea>Seoul District Court'],"['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Indigenous Groups']",['South Korea>Constitution'],Whether Tiwi Islanders were adequately consulted and environmental and climate harms properly assessed for the proposed Barossa pipeline that would run through a habitat protection zone near the Tiwi Islands. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/kand-v-ksureandkexim/
Violations of human rights by to Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina (BiH) and China due to coal fired plants in BiH,"On March 17, 2021, the two UN Special Procedures on human rights and hazardous wastes, Mr. Orellana, and human rights and the environment, Mr. Boyd, issued communications to Bosnia Herzegovina (BiH) and China in relation to the approval for construction or extension of several coal-fired power plants in BiH by Chinese-State Owned Enterprises and with finance from the China Development Bank. 

Civil society complained that the plants lead to water and air pollution, and negative effects on climate change. Amongst other complaints, it was noted that whilst air pollution is already a significant concern in BiH, especially in areas where coal fired plants are operating, new units and plants are still being planned and constructed. This will negatively affect the air quality and public health for decades, through emissions of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2, over hundreds of kilometers. Some adverse health impacts associated with one of the power stations (Tuzla) include thousands of cases of (chronic) bronchitis and asthma in children and adults, and over 150 hospitalizations for respiratory issues and cardiac arrest. It was also noted that the coal-fired plants negatively affect neighboring countries; under the Espoo Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context, transboundary air pollution requires an IEA and a notification of neighboring countries about potential transboundary pollution from coal power plants. 

According to the communication, the situation raises serious concerns about both BiH and Chinas failure to meet international human rights obligations for human and environmental rights. This includes the human rights to a healthy environment, life, health, bodily integrity, safe drinking water and sanitation. Moreover, the construction and operation of the new coal fired power plants exacerbate the already dangerous conditions of climate change by adding, and failing to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Several procedural environmental human rights were affected too, due to alleged failures to provide adequate information, access to justice and effective remedies on negative health impacts resulting from the plants emissions.

States bear obligations under the international human rights law framework to protect against human rights abuse within their territories and/or jurisdiction, by third parties, including business enterprises. Meeting these obligations requires States to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress any abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations, and adjudication, including in the sphere of environmental protection. The international legal instruments which form the basis for obligations are set out in an Annex, and include protection of aforementioned rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on Rights of the Child, the UNECE Aarhus Convention, the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The communication reiterates applicability of HRC General Comment No. 36 on the right to life with dignity to environmental degradation, pollution and climate change (paras. 26, 62) and the importance of protecting underlying environmental determinants of health under Article 14 ICESCR and 24 CRC, and related general comments.

Communications of the Special Procedures are not binding and cannot afford direct remedies, but the communication asked both BiH and China to, inter alia: (a) indicate measures to ensure how the plants comply with applicable national law, international environmental laws, and international human rights standards, including the right to information; (b) harmonize procedures for environmental permitting and regulation systems, including by conducting environmental human rights impact assessments based on comprehensive and consistent standards; (c) provide information and monitor negative health impacts of the plant; and (d) prevent negative human rights and environmental outcomes, e.g. by enforcing the polluter pays principle. It asked China to provide information on the impacts and damages of the pollution caused by Chinese-supported coal powered plants on global climate change, the environment and local communities; or to provide information on measures to ensure that projects under Chinas Belt and Road Initiative contribute to the decarbonization of the host states of projects an do not compromise mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.   
BiH did not respond to the communication. China replied on May 27, 2021, by stating that allegations of human rights violations by the project in question are not based on fact; they are purely false accusations. According to China, it actively assumes international responsibility for climate change, including to the Green Silk Road. It always requires enterprises to carry out foreign projects in compliance with the laws of countries or regions where they are located, and financial institutions abide by the concept of green credit. Specifically, the Tuzla plant is intended to replace outdated local units, and meet environmental requirements under EU carbon emissions standards, with positive benefits for the environment and huge local social and economic benefit through development and reliable energy supply.",Pending,['United Nations>UN Special Procedures>United Nations Special Rapporteurs'],"['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting']","['International Covenant on Social', 'Universal Declaration of Human Rights', 'International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights', 'United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child', ""UNHCR's Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights""]","Alleged violations of human rights related to pollution, waste and effects on climate change resulting from the operation of a number of Chinese-supported coal fired plants operating or planned to operate in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/violations-of-human-rights-by-to-federation-of-bosnia-herzegovina-bih-and-china-due-to-coal-fired-plants-in-bih/
Cooperatie Mobilisation for the Environment U.A and others v. Executive Board of Province of North Holland (Vattenfall Power Generations Netherlands BV intervening),"On September 9, 2019 and April 10, 2020, energy company Vattenfall attained permits to construct and use a new biomass facility at an existing energy generation facility in Diemen, currently encompassing two gas facilities and a residual warmth facility. Several non-governmental organisations, including Cooperatie Mobilisation for the Environment UA (MOB) and Natuurmonumenten, and local residents, objected the permit due to concerns for negative effects on nature and their (living) environments due to harmful emissions, particularly nitrogen oxide (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO2. Applicants argued that CO2 was not accounted for at all, but that the burning of wood pellets in this new biomass facility would lead to more CO2 emissions per unit of generated energy than a coal-fired plant. This increases the atmospheric concentration of CO2, accelerating global warming. They also argued that this violates the Paris Agreement, EU law and the national Climate Law.

On June 7, 2021, the District Court of North Holland ruled that the arguments of applicants related to CO2 emissions are not relevant to the permit procedure, since no evidence was presented on the direct and specific effects of CO2 emissions or global warming on the municipality of Diemen and it inhabitants. The evidence mostly referred to worldwide effects of CO2 emissions on the climate, rather than specific effects of the operation of the new biomass facility on the (direct) environment of the facility. Moreover, the court stated that, as affirmed in the Urgenda-case, the Paris Agreement lacks direct effects in the Dutch legal order. Third parties cannot directly derive rights or legal obligations from it. Even so, it is up to the Dutch government to decide which measures it takes to meet its climate targets, and the government has motivated its decision to pursue biomass on the basis because it views this  fuel as necessary for the energy transition, and biomass is viewed as a CO2-neutral renewable energy source under the Paris Agreement. The court explicitly states that the political-governance choice to use biomass as a transitional fuel, and whether this is indeed a suitable fuel that would allow States to meet their climate targets is not an aspect that can be considered during a permit procedure, or assessed by a court in a related procedure. Since biomass is considered a CO2-neutral energy source under the Paris Agreement, the court decides not to consider the applicants arguments and calculations related to CO2 emissions, definitions of biomass under REDD I and REDD II, carbon debt, regeneration periods for wood stocks, and carbon capture and storage. The case was dismissed on all counts.",Decided,['Netherlands>District Court North-Holland'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Other projects'],[],"Whether a permit for the construction and use of a biomass facility is lawful, considering the negative effects of higher emissions of nitrogen and CO2 on nature and the environment.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/cooperatie-mobilisation-for-the-environment-ua-and-others-v-executive-board-of-province-of-north-holland-vattenfall-power-generations-netherlands-bv-intervening/

"Women from Huasco and Others v. the Government of Chile, Ministry of Energy, Environment and Health","On November 25, 2021, the residents of Huasco, headed by a group of women, filed a constitutional action against the State of Chile. In their claim, they demand the shutdown of two units of the thermoelectric power plant AES Gener Guacolda. The plaintiffs indicate that while Chile is a party to the Paris Agreement and has recently approved an agreement on the decarbonization of coal-fired power plants, it still decided - without justification - that the closure of Guacolda will only take place in 2040. 

The plaintiffs claim that the decision violates their constitutional rights to life, to live in an environment free of pollution, and equality before the law. According to them, the power plant's emissions are affecting the health of residents and neighbors of Huasco. They request a plan from the government to mandate the shutdown of the two units of the thermoelectric power plant and a compensation plan for the harmful emissions.

In its response, the Government of Chile requested the dismissal of the complaint as it argued there was no breach of fundamental rights. The government explained that decarbonization is voluntary for both the executive branch and the private companies. They point out that the Ministry of Energy's Decree No. 50/2020, approving the decarbonization agreement, is an administrative act that is constantly updated. Further, the decision to close the power plant relies on a combination of factors.

On May 2, 2022, the Court of Appeals of Copiapo rejected the claim on procedural grounds. The Court found that the matter in question was beyond its competence, as it involved the exercise of powers belonging to the executive branch. The thermoelectric closure is a complex process involving different factors and not just the executive government.

FOCSIV and others v. FCA Italy (Stellantis NV),"On April 4, 2022, FOCSIV and many other Italian associations submitted a specific instance to the National Contact Point on the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises at the Italian Ministry on Economic Development. It was addressed to FCA Italy, a leading Italian company in the automotive sector and part of Stellantis NV. 

The need for decarbonization and ecological transition is pushing the automotive sector to increase production of electric cars. This increase, in turn, is boosting the demand for raw materials needed to produce lithium-ion rechargeable batteries. Cobalt is one such material and a high percentage of it comes from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), where serious human rights violations have been reported in mining operations. 

The applicants claim that FCA Italy, which purchases an increasing amount of cobalt from the DRC, is failing to provide adequate information about its suppliers, contrary to the relevant provisions of the OECD 'Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises.' 

On April 11, 2022, the Italian National Contact Point held that it does not have territorial jurisdiction to hear the case, as the FCAs parent company Stellantis NV is based in the Netherlands.

Amis de la Terre and Sherpa v. Perenco,"Perenco is a French oil company specialized in the optimization of previously exploited oil wells. The company is increasingly present in Africa, and is the only oil operator present in the DRC. According to Friends of the Earth, Perenco has been implicated in numerous reports, investigations and interpellations by the Congolese Senate, local associations, and international NGOs for serious environmental and health violations.

Sherpa and Friends of the Earth France would like to take legal action to determine Perenco's responsibility for the reported pollution and environmental damage, and to obtain compensation, if necessary. Given the opacity of the operations and organization of the oil multinational, they have first initiated an action under article 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain more evidence of the link between Perenco France and the companies operating locally in the DRC. 

In 2019, Sherpa and Friends of the Earth France requested authorization to access internal documents of the company Perenco, to determine its role in activities denounced as harmful to the environment in the DRC. The Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris and then the Paris Court of Appeal denied their request on September 17, 2020. Therefore, they appealed to the Court of Cassation.

The multinational argued that the case was inadmissible and should be decided according to Congolese law (which would have prevented the associations from gaining access to the evidence requested). The associations argued the admissibility of the action should be decided according to French law, which explicitly allows for action for compensation for ecological damage. They argued that they had standing and that the case was admissible because (i) they are an environmental protection association established in France, (ii) requesting all measures to preserve evidence that could determine the outcome of a future lawsuit to engage the liability of a company whose registered office is located in France, for environmental infringements carried out abroad.

On March 9th, 2022, the Court of Cassation ruled in favor of the associations. The Court of Cassation held that 
(i)	any interested party may ask the French judge for an investigative measure if there is a legitimate reason to preserve or establish, before any proceedings, evidence which could be relevant to the resolution of a dispute, provided that the action envisaged is not manifestly inadmissible or would be contrary to the law or doomed to failure. 
(ii)	With regard to the conflict of laws, a claimant for compensation for environmental damage or subsequent damage may choose to invoke either the law of the country in which the damage occurred or the law of the country in which the event giving rise to the damage occurred. Here, in the case of environmental damage suffered in the DRC due to the de facto control and dominant influence of the company whose head office is in France over the companies of the group operating in the DRC, the event giving rise to the damage is located in France.
(iii)	Therefore, the right to request any measures to preserve or establish evidence that could be relevant to the outcome of a case with a view to holding a company, whose registered office is located in France, liable for environmental damage observed abroad, is defined in the lex fori. The lex fori (or law of the forum) is an international law principle, which provides that the law of the jurisdiction or venue in which a legal action is brought applies.

Mejillones Tourist Service Association and others with the Environmental Evaluation Service (SEA) of Antofagasta,"On September 9, 2021, the Mejillones Tourist Services Association and other local community organizations brought a constitutional action before the Court of Appeals of Antofagasta challenging the rejection by the Environmental Assessment Service of Antofagasta to include climate change variables into the exceptional revision of the Environmental Assessment Resolution No 290/2007 of September 7, 2007, of the thermoelectric power plant Angamos of AES Gener company. The plaintiffs claimed that the lack of consideration of climate change violated their constitutional rights to life, equality before the law, the right to live in an environment free of pollution, and property rights. 

On August 31, 2021, the Court of Appeals of Antofagasta rejected the plaintiff's claim on procedural grounds (Case No 6930-2021). The Court found that the matter in question was beyond its competence, as it involved the exercise of powers belonging to the executive branch. It added that the controversy is a matter under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Court.  The plaintiffs subsequently appealed the decision. 

On April 19, 2022, the Chilean Supreme Court (Case No. 71.628-2021) overruled the decision of the Court of Appeals and upheld the plaintiff's appeal. The ruling orders the Antofagasta Environmental Assessment Service (EAS) to include environmental variations caused by climate change in the extraordinary review process of the Environmental Authorization for the project. The Supreme Court understood that the article 25 quinquies of Law No 19.300 allows this review, including variables that were not considered when granting the original resolution of environmental qualification. The judgment expressly mentions Chile's obligations under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, considering that this mechanism is applicable to regulate situations that were not previously foreseen, such as the climate change variable. Therefore, the SEA must initiate an analysis of the atmosphere component, considering the elements that have changed in the terrestrial environment caused by climate change.",Decided,"['Chile>Court of Appeal of Antofagasta', 'Chile>Supreme Court']",['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Utilities'],"['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Chile>Law 19.300', 'Chile>Constitution of Chile']",Whether the environmental assessment of an thermoelectric power plant should consider climate change. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mejillones-tourist-service-association-and-others-with-the-environmental-evaluation-service-sea-of-antofagasta/
Sierra Club Canada Foundation et al. v. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Canada et al.,"In this case, the applicants, Sierra Club Canada Foundation and Equiterre filed an application for judicial review of the federal Minister of Environment and Climate Changes (the Minister) decision approving, with conditions, the environmental assessment for the Bay du Nord Development Project (the Project), and authorizing the Project to proceed, under the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act, 2012 (the Act). The application also names the Attorney General of Canada and the proponent of the Project, Equinor Canada Ltd. (Equinor), as respondents.

Equinor is proposing to develop the Project in the Flemish Pass offshore Newfoundland, with expected reserves of 300 million barrels of oil. In approving the Project, the Minister took into account the environmental assessment report for the Project, prepared by the Impact Assessment Agency of Canada. The Minister determined that the Project was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects. 

The applicants submit that the environmental assessment report did not satisfy the requirements under the Act or the guidelines for the assessment of the Project. Among other things, the applicants allege that the report did not acknowledge all of the GHG emissions associated with the Project, including downstream GHG emissions which could account for 90% of the Projects total emissions, and the effects related to additional production for the Project. Therefore, the applicants submit that the report failed to consider all of the Project effects and was therefore deficient. As a result, the Minister lacked jurisdiction to make the decision as he relied on a report that did not meet the requirements under the Act. 

The applicants further allege that the Ministers decision that the Project was not likely to cause significant adverse environmental effects as set out under the Act was unreasonable, as the Minister failed to consider downstream GHG emissions, the cumulative effects of the emissions, the effects of shipment and transportation of oil and other effects of the Project. Moreover, in their view, the Minister did not provide any justification as to why he did not consider those effects. The applicants argue that the Minister had information on the GHG emissions from the Project, including that the oil produced by the Project could cause approximately 129 megatonnes of GHG emissions. In their view, the Minister did not consider the information before him in his decision to approve the Project. 

The applicants are requesting that the Federal Court of Canada (i) find that the Ministers decision is beyond the jurisdiction of the Minister and therefore invalid, (ii) issue an order that the Ministers decision is unreasonable and therefore invalid, and (iii) issue an order quashing his decision.

Altius Royalty Corporation et al. v. Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Alberta et al.,"In this case, the plaintiffs, Altius Royalty Corporation, Genesee Royalty Limited Partnership and Genesee Royalty GP Inc., alleged de facto expropriation of their royalty interest in coal from the Genesee Coal Mine caused by the defendant federal governments regulations prohibiting coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and the agreement between the owners of Genesee Power Plant and the government of Alberta, also a defendant, for the provision of transition payments to the owners of such plant in exchange for ceasing coal-fired emissions from the plant by December 31, 2030. 

The case was first heard by a Master, who, among other things, granted the defendants motion for summary dismissal of the plaintiffs claim for de facto expropriation of its royalty interest (Altius Royalty Corporation v. Alberta, 2021 ABQB 3).

The plaintiffs have a royalty interest in coal produced from the Genesee Coal Mine in Alberta, which is dedicated to fueling the Genesee Power Plant. The plant generates coal-fired electricity for the City of Edmonton and elsewhere. The plaintiffs paid, collectively, $460 million for the royalty interest in the coal at the mine.    

In 2012, the federal government adopted the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (2012 Regulations) aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants, which did not directly bind the Genesee Power Plant at the time. The 2012 Regulations permitted the plant to operate as it was from an emissions perspective until its power plant units would be deemed to end their useful life (estimated to be in 2039, 2044 and 2055) under the 2012 Regulations. The plaintiffs claimed that because the 2012 Regulations permitted the units to operate as they were from an emissions perspective for 50 years from their commissioning dates, a reduction in that ability entitled the plaintiffs to compensation. 

In 2015, the government of Alberta introduced its Climate Leadership Plan which aimed to phase out emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. The government of Alberta entered into an off-coal agreement with the owners of the Genesee Power Plant, where the owners agreed to end emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and, in return, the government of Alberta agreed to pay certain transition payments. The plaintiffs alleged that by entering into the agreement with the Genesee Power Plant owners, the government of Alberta engaged in conduct that compensated the plant owners but excluded the plaintiffs. 

In 2018, new federal regulations came into force amending the 2012 Regulations (the 2018 Regulations). The 2018 Regulations affected existing plants, including the Genesee Power Plant, and required that they meet the new emissions standards set out in the regulation by December 31, 2029. The plaintiffs alleged that, based on the 2012 Regulations, the plaintiffs had counted upon the royalty stream being available to 2039, 2044 and 2055. The plaintiffs alleged that the 2018 Regulations amounted to a constructive expropriation or taking by the federal government of its royalty interest in the coal after 2030. 

The Master found that the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations, was not a taking by the federal government and that the actions of the government of Alberta to enter into an off-coal agreement (and other actions) compensating the Genesee Power Plant owners did not amount to takings or actionable wrongs. These actions therefore did not create a cause of action in favour of the plaintiffs. For those reasons, the Master dismissed the plaintiffs actions. 

In reviewing the Masters decision to grant summary dismissal of the plaintiffs claim for de facto expropriation, the Court determined whether the defendants had met the requirements for a finding of a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law: (i) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it and (ii) removal of all reasonable uses of the property. The Court found that the requirements had not been met, as there was no evidence that the defendants would, in some way, recover a freehold interest in the coal and that the defendants have an interest in keeping the coal in the ground (in its natural state). The Court found that the defendants interest was reducing Canadas production of greenhouse gas emissions, as manifested in the Paris Agreement and the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations. The Court agreed with the Masters finding that the defendants had proven on a balance of probabilities that there was no merit to the plaintiffs claim.

Greenpeace Canada v. Shell Canada,"The complainant, Greenpeace Canada, submitted a formal complaint to the Competition Bureau of Canada alleging that Shells Drive Carbon Neutral products are making false and/or misleading representations to the public in contravention of the federal Competition Act.

In its complaint to the Competition Bureau of Canada, Greenpeace Canada takes issue with Shells alleged claim that, through Shells Drive Carbon Neutral program, customers can reduce the carbon emissions from their fuel purchases by offsetting those emissions from three forest-based offset projects that Shell supports. Greenpeace Canada claims that Shell is making false and/or misleading representations to the public with respect to its Drive Carbon Neutral products as (i) Shell has not demonstrated the validity of their carbon neutral claim and (ii) the offsets used have serious legitimacy concerns. 

Moreover, Greenpeace Canada alleges that by making its Carbon Neutral Drive program (and the use of offsets) a public part of Shells action to address climate change, Shell is using greenwashing to distract from the need to reduce the use of Shells fossil fuel products and for Shell to take its own actions to reduce GHG emissions.

Sierra Club of British Columbia Foundation v. Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy,"In this case, the petitioner, Sierra Club of BC, is challenging the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategys (government of British Columbia) 2021 Climate Change Accountability Report (the 2021 Report) on the grounds that it did not meet the requirements under the Climate Change Accountability Act. The Act requires the government of British Columbia to publish annual reports on, among other things, its plan to continue progress toward reaching its climate targets set out in the Act. 

Sierra Club of BC is arguing that the Ministers 2021 Report does not meet the requirements of the Climate Change Accountability Act as it does not include a plan to continue progress toward the 2025, 2040 and 2050 greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets referred to in the Act. Moreover, the petition alleges that the 2021 Report also fails to include a plan to continue progress toward the greenhouse gas emissions reduction target set for the oil and gas sector. Sierra Club of BC is asking the British Columbia Supreme Court to quash and set aside the 2021 Report because of an error of law, as it allegedly does not meet the requirements under the Climate Change Accountability Act, and remit the 2021 Report to the Minister for reconsideration. Finally, Sierra Club of BC submits that it has public interest standing and the issue it seeks to raise with the Court is justiciable. Therefore, it submits that it has standing to seek judicial review of the 2021 Report. In its response to the petition, the Minister of Environment and Climate Change Strategy submits that the 2021 Report meets the requirements set out under the Climate Change Accountability Act as it contains plans to continue progress toward the emissions reduction targets set out in that Act. 

The Minister alleges that the substance of Sierra Club of BCs petition is not that the 2021 Report is devoid of plans, but that Sierra Club of BC is not satisfied with the content, detail and/or sufficiency of the plans set out in the 2021 Report. As such, the Minister submits that the petitioners challenge to the adequacy of the 2021 Report is not a justiciable issue. Therefore, Sierra Club of BC does not have standing. The Minister also submits that the Court should deny the relief sought by Sierra Club of BC without a full hearing on the merits for unreasonable delay, given that the petition was brought more than 5 months after the 2021 Report was issued.

"Ecology Action Centre v. Nova Scotia (Environment), 2022 NSSC 104","The applicants, the Ecology Action Centre and New Brunswick Anti-Shale Gas Alliance, sought judicial review of the Minister of Environment and Climate Changes decision to approve a highway realignment project related to the Goldboro LNG Project. The Minister of Environment and Climate Change brought a motion alleging, among other things, that the applicants should not be granted public interest standing to start judicial review of the decision. 

The applicants argued that the Minister (i) failed to provide the applicants with the written statement of the decision, including findings of facts upon which it based its decision and the reasons for the decision, contrary to the requirements set out in the Environment Act, (ii) erred in making the decision, and (iii) failed to properly consider the comments received from the applicants and other participants during the public consultation process. The applicants argued that, among other things, the Minister failed to consider their comments concerning greenhouse gas emissions and the risks of carrying out the project in an area already significantly impacted by historical gold mining activity and contaminated by toxic gold mine tailing deposits.

In determining whether to grant public interest standing, the Court was required to determine whether (i) there was a serious, justiciable issue raised, (ii) the applicants had a real stake or genuine interest in the matter, and (iii) in all the circumstances, the proposed suit was a reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the Court. 

On the question of whether it was a serious and justiciable issue, the Court determined that reasonableness of the Ministers decision to approve the highway realignment project was justiciable. However, it found that it was not a serious issue, given that the application related solely to the decision to allow the highway realignment project, rather than the decision to approve the overall Goldboro LNG Project (which was approved in 2014). The Court determined that the applicants primary concern was with the GHG that would be emitted by the Goldboro LNG Project, not the highway realignment project. On the question of whether the applicants had a real stake or genuine interest in the matter, based on their respective mandates related to the environment and climate change, the Court determined that the applicants had a genuine interest in the matter. On the question of whether the proposed suit was a reasonable and effective way to bring the issue before the Court, the Court acknowledged that an application for judicial review was the only mechanism available to challenge the Ministers decision. The Court added that the applicants brought a perspective to the issues which were distinct from those more directly affected. In weighing all of the factors cumulatively, the Court found that they did not support granting public interest standing to the applicants. The Court accepted that climate change and the environmental impacts from natural gas production are important issues, but that the decision in question was about the approval of a highway realignment (with secondary greenhouse gas emissions concerns compared to the actual Goldboro project). 

The applicants application for judicial review of the decision to approve the highway realignment project was dismissed. However, the Court allowed the applicants application for judicial review regarding whether the Minister failed to provide the applicants with the written statement of the decision contrary to the requirements set out in the Environment Act to proceed to a hearing on the merits.",Decided,['Canada>Nova Scotia'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],['Canada>Environment Act (Nova Scotia)'],"Whether the applicants had standing in the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia to challenge, among other things, the decision of the Minister of Environment and Climate Change to approve a highway realignment project related to the Goldboro LNG Project.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ecology-action-centre-v-nova-scotia-environment-2022-nssc-104/
"Raincoast Conservation Foundation, et al. v. Attorney General of Canada, et al.","The applicants, Raincoast Conservation Foundation and Living Oceans Society, sought leave to appeal the Federal Court of Canadas decision in Raincoast Conservation Foundation et al. v. Canada (Attorney General) et al., 2019 FCA 224 (No. 19-A-35). In that case, the Federal Court of Appeal dismissed their motion for leave to start an application for judicial review against the Governor in Councils decision to approve the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project under the National Energy Board Act.

At the Federal Court of Appeal, the applicants raised issues concerning the impacts of the Trans Mountain Pipeline project on southern resident killer whales, the requirements of the Species at Risk Act in the context of environmental assessments of projects likely to adversely affect species at risks, and the interplay between the Species at Risk Act and the Canadian Environmental Assessment Act. The applicants argued that, among other things, increased tanker traffic related to the project and risk of a catastrophic oil spill associated with the project would pose significant additional threats to the southern resident killer whales. The applicants also argued that the Governor in Council had no jurisdiction to make a decision with respect to the project without ensuring that the requirements under the Species at Risk Act were met.  

In its decision, the Federal Court of Appeal determined that the applicants arguments on the environmental issues could not meet the threshold of a fairly arguable case and therefore denied them leave to start a judicial review. The Federal Court of Appeal determined that the applicants argument on the Governor in Councils lack of jurisdiction was not fairly arguable because the Federal Court of Appeal had specifically rejected it in Tsleil-Waututh Nation v. Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 15 (the 2018 Tsleil-Waututh Nation Case) (where the Federal Court of Appeal set aside the Governor in Councils first approval of the Trans Mountain Pipeline expansion project). The Court also found that the alleged flaws in the National Energy Boards examination of environmental matters under the Species at Risk Act were not fairly arguable because they were raised and decided or could have been raised in the 2018 Tsleil-Waututh Nation Case.

In the matter of AGL Limited,"The board of AGL Energy Limited, Australias biggest greenhouse gas emitter, announced in 2021 that they intended to pursue a demerger creating two separate entities, AGL Australia Limited (a retailer) and Accel Energy Limited (a generator). The proposed demerger was being pursued by way of a scheme of arrangement under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), which requires Court approval at two stages, along with a shareholder vote. Initially, the Court must approve the materials that AGL puts to shareholders for the vote and to convene the scheme meeting where the vote takes place. Shareholders are typically unable to access the materials prior to the first hearing of the application. In the present case, the plaintiff was a high value shareholder of AGL who, without having access to those materials, was concerned that those materials may not adequately address climate risks associated with the demerger.

On 5 May 2022, at a hearing of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, the plaintiff sought leave to be heard in the Courts hearing of the application, including on the basis that the proposed demerger was not in the best interests of shareholders. Leave was granted and AGL tendered the scheme materials and was required to provide the materials to the plaintiff to review. The Court made orders to publish the scheme booklet unamended, however, it ordered that the videos that AGL proposed to publish on the demerger were to be amended to disclose the risks and disadvantages of the demerger.

Gaurav Bansal v. Union of India,"In 2014, an application was filed by Gaurav Bansal, an environmental activist and lawyer, before the National Green Tribunal (NGT) against the Ministry of Environment and Forests questioning the state governments implementation of the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC). The NAPCC identifies measures that promote Indias development objectives while also yielding co-benefits for addressing climate change effectively. The plan sets out eight multi-pronged, long-term and integrated core missions that include solar mission, enhanced energy efficiency, sustainable habitat, integrated water resource management, sustaining Himalayan ecosystem, sustainable agriculture and strategic knowledge for climate change. NAPCC mandates the state governments to develop their respective State Action Plans on Climate Change (SAPCC) in order  to achieve coherence between the strategies and actions at sub-national level.  SAPCC aim to mainstream climate change concerns in the State planning process.

On July 23, 2015, the NGT in its final order did not directly rule on its jurisdiction over the implementation of NAPCC and specific State climatic violation of consequences. However, it directed the erring State governments to prepare their respective draft plan to be approved by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change and have the same approved expeditiously. Further, the tribunal held that in future specific violation of NAPCC, its impact and consequences, could be filed before it.

Indian Council for Enviro-Legal Action (ICELA) v. MoEF,"In 2014, ICELA, an environmental NGO, filed an application against the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change, and companies producing HCFC- 2 to stop emitting HFC-23. The emission of this by-product has 14,800 times more global warming potential (being a greenhouse gas) compared to carbon dioxide thereby leading to ozone depletion. The excessive release of greenhouse gas may set off a climate bomb and severely affect the environment. The petitioner relied on constitutional mandates, namely Articles 48A (duty of the state to protect the environment), 51A(g) (fundamental duty of the citizen to protect and improve the environment), and section 3 of the Environment Protection Act 1986 that give powers to Central Government to take such measures as deemed necessary or expedient for the purpose of protecting and improving quality of the environment and preventing, controlling and abating environmental pollution. However, the respondent, namely, the Ministry of Environment and Forests raised a preliminary objection by stating that the petition is unmaintainable as it falls outside the jurisdiction of the National Green Tribunal. The bye-product HFC-23 does not fall within the Acts specified in Schedule-I of the NGT Act and therefore the tribunal could not entertain the petition.

On 10th December 2015, the NGT held it has the jurisdiction to hear the case as the greenhouse gas has been a matter of concern at the national and international level as part of the environment. The NGT Act 2010 is social welfare legislation and intended to provide expeditious justice in civil environmental cases. However, the tribunal found that the regulation of HFC-23 relates to a matter of global policy which must be regulated under international law. As such the court understood that there would be a very little role for the statutory authorities within the country to take appropriate measures. 

The tribunal acknowledged that undisputedly HFC-23 has an effect on global warming being part of greenhouse gases, and at present there is a gap in scientific understanding of HFC-23s toxic impact on the air and its categorization as a pollutant. The tribunal further observed the international conventions and treaties have to provide a path for domestic legislation and in any case it has failed and be regulated without further delay. Accordingly, the NGT directed the regulatory authorities and expert bodies to conduct a comprehensive data base study on HFC-23, being a pollutant and the extent of its impact on global warming, being part of greenhouse gases.

This is a direct action of state unconstitutionality, with a request for a precautionary measure, filed by the Public Ministry of the State of Rondonia (MPRO) due to the enactment of the state Complementary Law (CL) 1.089/2021, on the initiative of the State Governor, questioning especially: (i) art. 1, caput, and its first and second paragraphs; (ii) art. 2, caput and paragraphs 1 and 2; (iii) art. 15, caput and sole paragraph; (iv) art. 17, caput and its sections; and (v) Annexes I, II, V, VI, VII and VIII. The CL reduces the area of the Jaci-Parana Extractive Reserve and the Guajara-Mirim State Park, and, as a form of compensation, creates the Ilha das Flores and Abaitara State Parks, the Bom Jardim and Limoeiro Sustainable Development Reserves, and the Pau D'Oleo Fauna Reserve. 

Additionally, the CL allows the environmental regularization of the property or possession to the owners or possessors in the unaffected areas of the Extractive Reserve and the State Park. It states that Conservation Units (CUs) are illegally occupied and that deforestation is occuring to the detriment of the rights of traditional populations (extractive and others). The CUs are being used mainly for cattle ranching. The disaffection of these spaces directly impacts the Uru-eu-wau-wau, Karipuna, Igarape Lage, Igarape Ribeirao, Karitina Indigenous Lands and the peoples in voluntary isolation in the surrounding region. 

The CL argues that the reduction of UCs, by harming environmental protection and contradicting the purpose for which the CUs were created, violates the right to an ecologically balanced environment and the duty of the Government and the collectivity of defense and preservation for the present and future. generations. It emphasizes that the creation of new areas protected by the CL is insufficient, being an environmental setback. In addition, it argues that there were no hearings with affected communities during the project that resulted in the CL and the preparation of technical studies for the disaffection of spaces, which violates the principles of prevention and precaution. It argues that the precautionary measure must be granted, as there is a risk of irreversible environmental damage and imminent risk to the lives of indigenous peoples and traditional populations.

The CL emphasizes that the Jaci-Parana Extractive Reserve is already the 2nd most deforested in the Legal Amazon, while the Guajara-Mirim State Park is the 9th most deforested. Finally, it requests: (i) injunction, the suspension of the effectiveness of the disputed provisions; and (ii), on the merits, the declaration of unconstitutionality of the provisions, and the decision must be communicated to the Legislative Assembly for the suspension of its execution. 

In a monocratic decision, the Judge-Rapporteur, Jose Jorge Ribeiro da Luz, decided that he will only judge the merits of the action, since, as the precautionary measure in the ADI must be granted by an absolute majority of the members of the Court, the time for consideration of both will be the same. In the same decision, he granted the application for admission as amicus curiae of the Minas Novas Rural Producers Association (ASPRUMIN). 

Subsequently, the application for admission as amicus curiae of the Ethnoenvironmental Defense Association (KANINDE), the Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Guaraja-Mirim Region (Oro Wari), the Ecopore Ecological Action (ECOPORE), the SOS Amazon Association (SOS Amazonia), and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF-Brasil) was granted. It is noteworthy that, in the amicus curiae reasons, the organizations, when defending the unconstitutionality of CL 1.089/21, pointed out that the norm represents damage to biodiversity, to local traditional and indigenous populations and to climate stability by summarily acquitting environmental offenders who occupied and degraded the protected areas, receiving the seal of the Government. 

The organizations highlighted the violation of the principles of prevention and precaution, provided for in the National Environmental Policy - PNMA (Federal Law 6.938/1981) and in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), as well as the violation of the right to prior, free and informed consultation of affected indigenous and traditional peoples, in accordance with Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). They argued that the reduction of CUs results in climate damage, violating the right to climate stability provided for in Article 225 of the Federal Constitution and also defended that the Government fails to implement the PNMC and the State Policy on Climate Governance and Environmental Services - PGSA (State Law 4.437/2018). 

Judgment was rendered, according to the vote of the Judge-Rapporteur, who, by majority, declared the unconstitutionality of the contested provisions, as well as recognized the unconstitutionality by dragging LC 1.096/2021, which amends the wording of 1 of Article 2 of CL 1.089/2021. It concluded by the absence of previous studies for the disaffection of the CUs violating the principles of precaution, prevention and prohibition of environmental setback. He emphasized that it is the duty of the Public Power to protect the environment, with the justification of anthropization and degradation in the areas being flawed. Furthermore, it understood that the principles of ubiquity and intergenerational solidarity had been violated. 

The vote of Judge Miguel Monico Neto stands out, who, although he also recognizes the unconstitutionality of the rules, was defeated in the part in which he emphasizes the need for a structuring measure due to the abuse of the legislative institutional function of the State Governor and the Legislative Assembly. The Judge emphasized the importance of CUs for protection against the climate emergency and added that the environmental impacts resulting from new agricultural projects in the area, if the reduction of protected areas were implemented, would represent a threat to the environment, water security, the climate system, soil fertility, atmospheric air, fauna and flora, the health and life of present and future generations, as well as the sustainability of agriculture and livestock and the exports of state and Brazilian products.",Pending,['Brazil>Court of the State of Rondonia'],[],"['Brazil>Federal Law 9 985/2000 (National System of Nature Conservation Units  SNUC)', 'ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169', 'Brazil>State Constitution (Rodonia)', 'Brazil>State Policy on Climate Governance and Environmental Services (Rodonia)']",  ,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=16978
Public Ministry of the State of Goias v. Goias State (State air quality control public policy),"Petition on October 29, 2021.  

This is a Public Civil Action, with a preliminary injunction, proposed by the Public Ministry of the State of Goias (MPGO) against the State of Goias. It seeks to oblige the State to take the necessary measures to improve air quality and, consequently, safeguard the health of the population through the implementation of an environmental public policy for monitoring and controlling atmospheric pollution and climate change. 

The plaintiff claims that the regional government is omitting to comply with public policies for environmental control, aimed at protecting air and climate quality. It highlights the repeated state inertia in combating climate change, controlling atmospheric pollution and monitoring vehicular pollution, evidenced by the non-execution of technical actions, such as the implementation of a network of air quality monitoring stations, carrying out an inventory of emissions of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) and from mobile sources, as well as the implementation of Inspection and Maintenance Programs for Vehicles in use. It also highlights the omission regarding the need to analyze climate impacts in environmental licensing procedures in the State. 

The plaintiff states that, in line with the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009)), the State Policy on Climate Change (PEMC (State Law 16,497/2009)) was instituted, but few public policies were implemented. It highlights the lack of implementation of instruments to prevent atmospheric pollution and climate change, especially the Atmospheric Emissions Control Plan (PCEA) and the Vehicle Pollution Control Plan (PCPV). It highlights the insufficiency of the PCPV in the State of Goias. It highlights the risks of damage to human health and the environment resulting from air pollution and noise pollution. Links air pollution caused by burning fossil fuels to the climate crisis. 

The plaintiff requests, in preliminary injunction, that the State of Goias be determined to adopt measures aimed at the implementation of Conama Resolutions 01/1993, 02/1993, 418/2009 and 491/2018, of Federal Laws 8,723/1993, 9,503/1997 and 12,187/2009, of the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9,073/2017) and of State Law 16,497/2009. On the merits, it requires that the State of Goias be condemned, among other measures: 
(i) to implement public environmental policies to control pollution and combat climate change, through the elaboration of the PCEA, contemplating the network for monitoring the air quality throughout the state, both from mobile and stationary sources of gas emissions;
(ii) to implement an air quality monitoring network throughout the State; 
(iii) to update the PCPV; 
(iv) to prepare, implement and execute the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program (I/M) and the annual Environmental Vehicle Inspection Program of gas and noise emissions in motor vehicles; 
(v) to define and publish Administrative Regulations that establish (v.1) activities with significant GHG emissions for the purposes of environmental licensing and the requirement to present the GHG Emission Inventory, (v.2) Term of Reference criteria (TR) for the preparation of the Inventory and (v.3) technical criteria and standards for the assessment of environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in environmental licensing procedures in the State, as well as instruments for GHG mitigation and compensation; 
(vi) to prove the requirement in all environmental licensing procedures in progress, which have an Environmental Impact Study and the respective Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA), an inventory of GHG emissions, as well as the obligation to present an evaluation of environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in the TRs; and 
(vii) to prepare a State Inventory of GHG Emissions.

"Arayara Association of Education and Culture and others v. FUNAI, Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. and FEPAM (Mina Guaiba Project and affected indigenous communities)","On September 27, 2019, the Arayara Association of Education and Culture and the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association filed a Public Civil Action, with a request for a preliminary injunction, proposed by against FUNAI (the Brazilian agency for Indigenous groups), Copelmi Mineracao Ltda., a mining company, and FEPAM (the state environmental agency). Subsequently, CAPG and the Comunidade da Aldeia Guarani Guajayvi joined the claim as plaintiffs. The plaintiffs ask the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaiba Mina Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The authors claim that there is non-compliance with legal norms and omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), as well as the absence of prior, free and informed consultation with the indigenous people of the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association, especially the Aldeia (TeKoa) Guajayvi of the MBya Guarani people, located in Charqueadas/RS, less than 3 kilometers from the project site. When the case was filed, the project was in the preliminary permitting phase with FEPAM. According to the Consultation Notices referring to the environmental impact assessment, four public hearings were held. After the first two hearings, the period for sending public comments related to the project began. The authors allege that Aldeia Guajayvi submitted a request to submit comments, but was not heard. The plaintiffs therefore intend to prevent the development of the environmental permitting procedure while there is no proper assessment of the technical and locational feasibility of the project, including considering the State Policy on Climate Change (State Law 13,594/2010). 

The plaintiffs claim that coal mining generates relevant social and environmental impacts to nearby communities, and can cause irreparable environmental damage to these populations, especially due to atmospheric emissions of methane gas, spills and leaks of GHG, effluents and contamination of surface and underground waters, acid mine drainage, among others. They understand that national and international norms relating to indigenous rights have been violated, especially Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). In this sense, they argue that the absence of consultation with the indigenous community leads to the nullity of the EIA, requiring the suspension of the permitting process and subsequent annulment, so that specific consultation protocols are installed for the indigenous people who inhabit the region. They further claim that the Guaiba Mine will directly and permanently affect the indigenous community, violating their rights established by the constitution and international standards, generating several impacts. The plaintiffs claim that the defendants did not adopt measures aimed at allowing the maintenance of the indigenous community's ways of life. Further, FUNAI remained silent throughout the process, since it did not adopt preventive measures to safeguard the regular compliance with the permitting procedure, or support the indigenous people in the defense of their interests. The plaintiffs requested an injunction to immediately suspend of the permitting process until the final judgment. On the merits, they required the declaration of nullity of the permitting process. 

On February 21, 2020, the court of first instance granted the injunction and suspended the environmental permitting process, until the analysis by FUNAI of the Study of the Indigenous Component (ECI) is included in the EIA, prior to the issuance of an eventual permit by FEPAM, due to the following main reasons: (i) the continuity of the Project's licensing procedure without the inclusion of the ECI in the EIA and the lack of hearing from the affected indigenous communities will cause irreparable damage, based on ILO Convention 169; (ii) FEPAM should have asked FUNAI opine on the permit before issuing the permit, as there was no analysis by the ECI and prior hearing of the affected indigenous communities; (iii) FEPAM, before issuing the permit, must await the preparation and analysis of the ECI, as well as prior, free and informed consultation with the affected indigenous communities. 

On November 4, 2020, Copelmi filed a defense alleging, preliminarily, that (i) the request does not logically follow from the cause of action, which would give rise to the termination of the permitting process and that (ii) there is a lack of interest on the part of the plaintiffs. The company claimed that there was still no pronouncement from FEPAM regarding the environmental feasibility of the project and that, therefore, the agency has not yet decided on the possible granting of a permit. It argued that the case seeks to interrupt the evaluation by FEPAM and transfer to the judiciary the analysis of the merit of the environmental permitting process. The company further claimed that the damages presented by the authors do not exist and that part of them were contemplated and incorporated in the permitting, and FUNAI issued the terms of reference to carry out an ECI. In addition, it stressed that the only indigenous land around the project would be more than 8 km from the site, with no need for FUNAI to participate in the permitting conducted by FEPAM, nor for ECI to be carried out. However, after FUNAI confirmed the need for its participation and the preparation of an ECI, the company continued with the procedure. Therefore, it observed the prior consultation provided for in ILO Convention 169. Moreover, it stated that the process is still in the early permitting phase, and there can be no claim on the nullity of the permit. Finally, it requested: (i) the dismissal of the process without judgment on the merits, due to the ineptitude of the initial petition and lack of procedural interest; and (ii) the dismissal of the request. FEPAM, on the other hand, contested the claim and stated that there was no reason to be a defendant, since it does not oppose the intervention of FUNAI or an indigenous community in the permitting process. It claimed that it held two public hearings, which were widely publicized, guaranteeing the participation of interested parties. It highlighted that it has not yet concluded the analysis of the EIA presented by Copelmi. It defended the regularity of the project's environmental permitting process and the absence of environmental damage resulting from the project. It reinforced that there was no opposition regarding the participation of indigenous groups or the elaboration of the ECI. Finally, it requested the dismissal of the process without judgment on the merits in relation to FEPAM and that the demand against the agency to be dismissed. 

FUNAI claimed it intervened in the permitting process to protect the interests of indigenous peoples, and it was not possible to allege an omission. It highlighted that, in April 2020, the terms of reference for the preparation of the ECI was forwarded to FEPAM. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, entry into indigenous lands was suspended. It requested (i) the recognition of its illegitimacy as a defendant, with the extinction of the process without resolution of the merits, and (ii), on the merits, the recognition that there was no omission by FUNAI in monitoring the licensing. 

On February 8, 2022, the federal court of Rio Grande do Sul  handed down a ruling. The upheld the requests of the Arayara Association of Education and Culture and the Poty Guarani Indigenous Association to declare the nullity of the Mina Guaiba Project permitting process, ratifying the decision on the injunction. It rejected the preliminary allegations of incompetence of the Federal Court, of lack of procedural interest of the plaintiffs and of illegitimacy of FUNAI as a defendant. On the merits, the Court recognized the rights of indigenous communities to participate in decisions that may affect their way of life and culture. It concluded that the project's permitting process is already at an advanced stage, having carried out an EIA that disregards the existence of an indigenous community and that there was no participation in the discussions. It understood that the mere formal manifestation of FUNAI does not meet the need for hearing from the indigenous community potentially affected by the activity to be authorized.

"Lucas Martins and Paulo Henrique Nagelstein v. President of the Republic, President of the CNPE and the Federal Union (Reduction of the percentage of blending biodiesel in fossil diesel)","Petition on January 7, 2021. 
Appeal on February 17, 2022. 
Decision on April 11, 2022. 

This is a Popular Action with a request for an injunction, filed by two individuals against an act practiced by the President of the Republic, by the President of the CNPE (National Energy Policy Council) - occupation of the Minister of State for Mines and Energy - and by the Federal Union. 

The action seeks to annul the act that determined the reduction of the mandatory blending content of biodiesel in diesel oil to 10% during the year 2022 (""B10""), pursuant to Resolution CNPE 25/2021, approved by Order of the President of the Republic. The authors require the observation of CNPE Resolution 16/2018, so that the mandatory blending of biodiesel with diesel is 13% (B13) in January and February 2022 and 14% (B14) from March 2022, in keeping with the gradual increase in the mix previously announced by the authorities. They emphasize that the addition of biodiesel to fossil diesel contributes to reducing the harmful environmental impacts caused by the latter and reduces the dependence on oil for the formation of diesel. 

As a source of clean energy, biodiesel production became even more valued, especially considering the commitments assumed under the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9073/2017) and the institution of the National Biofuels Policy  RenovaBio (Federal Law 13,576/2017), which recognizes the strategic role of biofuels in the Brazilian energy matrix for energy security, market predictability and the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this sense, the CNPE, through resolutions, and the National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP) disclosed the percentage evolution of the biodiesel content to be mandatorily present in fossil diesel, being provided for in CNPE Resolution 16/2018 the mandatory percentage of 13% in March 2021, 14% in March 2022 and reaching 15% in March 2023. 

However, in 2021, the President of the Republic and the President of CNPE established a temporary measure to reduce the mandatory percentage to 10% for other auctions to be held in the year, with a view to reducing the price of diesel sold to end consumers. However, through CNPE Resolution 25/2021 and an order formalized in December 2021, the President of CNPE and the President of the Republic maintained the mandatory minimum percentage of 10% of biodiesel in diesel for the entire year of 2022, contrary to the previous CNPE resolution (16/2018). 

In view of these facts, the authors claim that this reduction during the year 2022 is harmful to the environment, administrative morality and public property, in addition to being unconstitutional and illegal. They add that the act practiced was not duly justified and that the Federal Union purposely omitted the 8th Extraordinary Meeting of the CNPE, which resulted in the change of the contested percentage. The authors claim that the percentage decrease in the mixture violates the legal order of environmental protection established in the constitutional, legal and international scope, comprising the Federal Constitution, the RenovaBio Law, the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187). /2009), the Paris Agreement and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and climate goals presented by Brazil. 

This is because this reduction generates an increase in GHG emissions, since it implies greater use of fossil fuels, and causes deterioration of public health. They maintain that there is damage to administrative morality as (i) the Public Administration contradicts its own norms and manifestations, (ii) there is damage in relation to the biodiesel production chain, and (iii) there is non-compliance with the objective and principle of promoting the predictability instituted by RenovaBio. Finally, the authors claim that the contested act harms public property by reducing the demand for biodiesel to be produced by the national industry. 

They require, as a preliminary injunction: (i) the suspension of the harmful act and, consequently, the determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018; and (ii) alternatively, while there is no publication of a conclusive technical note from the study group created to evaluate the blending of biodiesel in diesel, the suspension of the harmful act and determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018. Finally, they require: (i) the ratification of the preliminary injunction; (ii) the annulment of the harmful act; and (iii) the determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018, complying with the ""B13"" percentage in January and February 2022, and ""B14"" as of March 2022.",Pending,['Brazil>Rio Grande do Sul'],[],"['Brazil>Federal Constitution', 'Brazil>PNMC (Federal Law 12 187/2009)', 'Brazil>National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio)', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",   ,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=16991

This is a Public Civil Action (ACP), with a preliminary injunction, proposed by the NGO Costa Legal, UFECO and Pachamama Association, with the legal assistance of the Environmental Law and Political Ecology Research Group in the Risk Society (GPDA) and the Research Observatory of Ecological Justice (OJE), both from the Federal University of Santa Catarina (UFSC). Subsequently, the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), the Public Ministry of the State of Santa Catarina (MPSC) and the National Association of People Affected by Dams (ANAB) joined the active pole. 

The action was proposed against the Municipality of Florianopolis, FLORAM, the State of Santa Catarina, IMA/SC, CASAN and ARESC. The ACP aims to implement a socio-ecological governance system for the protection, control, monitoring and inspection of the ecological integrity of Lagoa da Conceicao, located in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina, through the adoption of structural measures. The authors present Lagoa da Conceicao as a subject of ecological rights and claim that, due to organized irresponsibility in the functioning of the current institutional structure, there is an unconstitutional state of affairs. They emphasize that there is, in its surroundings, a complex mosaic of dunes, sandbanks and forests, part of the Atlantic Forest biome, demonstrating an interface between terrestrial and marine ecosystems. 

They explain the importance of the ecosystem services provided by the Lagoa, especially for a greater capacity to adapt to climate change in ecosystems and nearby communities, which are more vulnerable to the effects of the increase in global temperature. They emphasize the role of the Lagoa in the local sociocultural history, highlighting the importance of water quality for the identity of the communities in the region. They emphasize that the risks of perishing and collapse of the Lagoa's ecosystem integrity are evident and urgent, causing damage to the effectiveness of fundamental rights and causing structural problems related to ineffective management and lack of effective and systemic ecological governance by the responsible actors. 

They claim that the impacts of human activities on ecological systems threaten diverse forms of life and are therefore a matter of ecological justice. Finally, they require, among the requests: (i) the recognition of the active legitimacy of the author associations to plead, in addition to the protection of collective rights to the environment, the protection of specific rights of Lagoa da Conceicao; (ii) the recognition of the existence of a structural problem so that the Judicial Chamber for the Protection of Lagoa da Conceicao (CJ-PLC), or similar body, is established; (iii) from the subsidies of the CJ-PLC, the determination to establish a Judicial Plan for the Protection of Lagoa da Conceicao (PJ-PLC); (iv) the determination to the defendants to promote, based on the results of the PJ-PLC, the establishment and maintenance of the Permanent Chamber for the Protection of Lagoa da Conceicao (CP-PLC), to continue the activities and structuring measures determined, to be performed by CJ-PLC; and (v) the declaration of Lagoa as a natural entity with specific rights. 

The preliminary injunction was granted, determining the creation of the CJ-PLC, with the purpose of advising the Court in the adoption of the necessary structural measures to guarantee the ecological integrity of the natural entity, to be composed with the participation of the defendants and interested in the deed. In addition, the decision welcomed the entry of the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) and the Public Ministry of Santa Catarina (MPSC) in the active pole. 

The State of Santa Catarina and CASAN filed Interlocutory Appeals (AI) due to this decision (AI 5025622-12.2021.4.04.0000 and AI 5029519-48.2021.4.04.0000, respectively) both with a request for suspensive effect, and that, among other preliminary points, they similarly support: 
(i) non-verification of the necessary requirements for granting urgent relief; 
(ii) that the granting of the injunction exhausts the object of the action; and 
(iii) that the decision violates the separation of Powers. 

Monocratic decisions were made, within the scope of the appeals, which concluded in the partial granting of the suspensive effect, in order to establish that the CJ-PLC is a merely consultative body, not equivalent to a public body, and that it does not have decision-making and imposition power. of obligations to any part of the process, as well as not enjoying the prerogatives of using public resources, in addition to having a role linked only to the object of lawsuits related to the preservation of the Lagoa that are being processed before the court of origin. This understanding was later confirmed in the final judgment of the AIs, in judgments that partially provided the resources to affirm the consultative nature of the CJ-PLC and the absence of decision-making power, the imposition of obligations and the use of public resources.

In the scope of the original action, the State of Santa Catarina presented a defense, defending, among other points: (i) the incompetence of the Federal Justice, since the Union, or its entities, is absent from any of the poles of the action; (ii) absence of a request against the State; (iii) passive illegitimacy of the federative entity, with only the IMA/SC to appear; (iv) the exclusively local interest of the demand; (v) the absence of a permissive legal provision for the creation of the Judicial Chamber; (vi) redundancy in relation to other committees created by law; (vii) the exhaustion of the object of the action due to measures taken in a related action (ACP 5004793-41.2021.4.04.7200); and (vii) that the requested measures violate the principle of separation of Powers, and the requests for provisional relief must be rejected. Finally, it requires (i) recognition of the incompetence of the Federal Court; (ii) your exclusion from the deed; and (iii) the dismissal of the requests. 

CASAN also contested the initial on several issues. He stated that it is structured in the midst of vague, abstract and common-sense expressions, criticizing the request about the Judicial Chamber for several aspects. He cited the decision rendered within the scope of the AI due to the new contours given to the role of the requested collegiate. In addition, he stated that there was no difference in the Judicial Chamber claimed in relation to the existing popular collegiate bodies. He argued that there is lis pendens in relation to other processes that have the same claim. He stated that the state of affairs was not unconstitutional, refuting the alleged lack of environmental governance. Finally, it fought for the dismissal of the case without resolution of the merits, or, if there is an analysis of the merits, it fights for the dismissal of the ACP. 

Subsequently, the IMA/SC also filed a contestation. In his defense, he stated that there was no procedural interest and highlighted the reserve of discretion of the Executive Power, and of its autarchies, as well as affirming that the postulated Chamber has no legal provision. It requested the dismissal of the process without judgment on the merits in the face of the IMA and, successively, the rejection of the claim as formulated. However, he highlighted his non-opposition to the creation of the CP-PLC as long as it has a merely consultative character. The Municipality of Florianopolis and FLORAM filed a defense claiming that the plaintiffs' claim removes the autonomy of the municipal Executive Power and creates obligations based on generic and unsubstantiated allegations. 

They stated that there was no justification for creating the external body, given that public entities had complied with all their legal obligations. Finally, they requested: (i) the dismissal of the requests, in respect of the principle of separation of Powers and the autonomy of administrative bodies; or (ii), if the Court deems otherwise, maintaining the CJ-PLC, limiting the scope of the Chamber as a merely advisory body. ARESC contests the initial, highlighting the steps taken in the sanitary sewage system. In addition, it emphasizes the autonomy and independence of its decisions. Thus, it requested the dismissal of the demand regarding ARESC, as it understands that it has been fulfilling its attributions and expressed its non-opposition to the participation of the Chamber if it is merely consultative.",Pending,['Brazil>Santa Catarina (SC)'],[],"['Brazil>Atlantic Forest Protection Law (Law 11 428/06)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution', 'Brazil>Forest Code (Law 12 651/2012)', 'Brazil>National Policy on Water Resources (Law 9 433/97)', 'Brazil>National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)']",  ,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=16995
"Federal Public Ministry, SOS Mata Atlantica and ABRAMPA v. Federal Union (MMA Order 4.410/2020 and special legislation for the Atlantic Forest)","Judgment on August 30, 2021.
Decision on August 28, 2020. 
Decision on August 5, 2020. 
Petition on May 6, 2020. 

This is a Public Civil Action, with a request for preliminary injunction, proposed by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF), SOS Mata Atlantica and ABRAMPA against the Federal Union, aiming at the declaration of nullity of Order 4.410/2020 issued by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA). The authors claim that the contested Order altered the understanding consolidated in Order MMA 64,773/2017 on the specialty of the Atlantic Forest Law (Law 11,428/2006) in the light of the Forest Code (Law 12,651/2012). They maintain that the entirety of the Atlantic Forest biome is subject to the Atlantic Forest Law, which, in its system, makes it impossible to consolidate illegally deforested Permanent Protection Areas (APP) occupations. It so happens that Order 4,410/2020 imposed guidance on federal public entities to apply the Forest Code, which is the most harmful general rule, allowing the consolidation of occupation of illegally deforested APPs (until July 22, 2008). 

They aim, among other issues, to prevent the cancellation of several notices of environmental infraction for deforestation and fire as a consequence of eventual consolidation of occupation of APPs. They point out that, in the national territory, the largest source of greenhouse gases (GHG) emission stems from deforestation and changes in land use, and that special legislation, such as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Law 12,187/2009 ), provides for the duty of preservation, conservation and recovery of the great natural biomes. Finally, they request, as an injunction, (i) the suspension of the effects of the contested Order 4.410/2021 and (ii) the restoration of the effects of the MMA Order 64.773/2017. 

On the merits, they require, among other issues, the confirmation of the preliminary injunction with the (i) declaration of nullity of the contested Order and (ii) the condemnation of the Federal Union to refrain from issuing another normative act of similar content, especially denying the prevalence of the special legislation of the Atlantic Forest on the Forest Code. 

The Court of the 20th Civil Court of the Judiciary Section of the Federal District (SJDF) declined jurisdiction in favor of the 1st Federal Civil Court of the SJDF, understanding that there is a connection with Popular Action 1024582-66.2020.4.01.3400. The Federal Union expressed itself for the loss of the object of the action, due to the spontaneous revocation of Decree 4.410/2020 and stressed that the matter was taken by the Federal Attorney General's Office to the Federal Supreme Court (STF), through the filing of an Action Direct of Unconstitutionality, so that the STF will decide, with binding effects and erga omnes, the best interpretation to be given to the normative plexus discussed. Thus, he requested the termination of the process. In a sentence, the Court of the 1st Federal Civil Court of the SJDF understood the plaintiffs' lack of interest in taking action, declaring the case extinct, without resolving the merits. The records were sent, by necessary remittance, to the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region, for the mandatory double degree of jurisdiction.

Mahendra Pandey v. Union of India,"On July 23, 2015, the NGT directed all states to expeditiously draft their action plans on climate change in according with the Centres National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) and have them approved by the Environment Ministry. Despite this direction, the Delhi state government failed to draft, finalize and implement the State Action Plan on Climate Change on the lines and the spirit of the NAPCC. The applicant, Mahendra Pandey, a scientist, contended that the Delhi government claimed to have formulated a Climate Change Agenda for the national capital in 2009. However, the Agenda expired in 2012 and since then Delhi has no Action Plan on Climate Change.

Accordingly, the NGT issued notices to the Delhi government to place on record relevant material and documents relating to steps taken by it in order to implement Action Plan on Climate Change. Consequently, the Delhi government prepared and submitted the climate action plan to the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change for approval.

Hindustan Zinc Ltd. v. Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission,"On 31st August 2012, the High Court of Rajasthan passed a judgment wherein  the companies having captive generation power plants were ordered to purchase minimum energy from renewable sources. The Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Renewable Energy Obligation) Regulations, 2007 and Rajasthan Electricity Regulatory Commission (Renewable Energy Certificate and Renewable Purchase Obligation Compliance Framework) Regulations 2010 imposed Renewable Energy obligation (RE obligation) on the captive generation entities to purchase minimum energy from renewable sources and to pay a surcharge in case of shortfall in meeting the RE obligation. 

Aggrieved by the judgment, in 2013 the captive generation companies filed an appeal before the Supreme Court. The companies contended that they have established their own captive generation power plants in terms of the Electricity Act, 2003. The purpose of the Electricity Act 2003 is to encourage participation of private sectors involved in generation of electricity and with that objective, generation of electricity was de-licensed and captive generation was freely promoted. It liberalized the establishment of captive power plants and exempted them from any licensing and regulatory regime. 

Further, the National Electricity Policy, 2005 and the Tariff Policy, 2006 were framed to promote production and utilization of energy to the maximum extent in respect of the captive generation plants. It was not intended to compulsorily force these companies to lower their production of energy by making them purchase renewable energy. Consequently, the 2007 and 2010 Regulations violative the basic object and purpose of the Electricity Act 2003. 

The moot issue in this case relates to whether the aggrieved captive power plant companies are covered by the 2007 and 2010 regulations that mandate green power purchase. On 13 May 2015, the Supreme Court of India upheld the validity of the 2007 and 2010 Regulations with respect to the renewable energy purchase obligation. The court approved the promotion and co-generation of electricity from renewable source of energy by employing constitutional mandates that focus on larger public interest and clean environment. The State and its instrumentalities are under a duty to protect the environment in order to ensure that the citizens/residents of the area lead a healthy life. This is the laudable object of the State and to achieve the same it has framed the respective electricity policies and regulations. Accordingly the Supreme Court observed the National Action Plan on Climate Change and Preamble of the Act of 2003 emphasises promotion of efficient and environmentally benign policies to encourage generation and consumption of green energy to sub-serve the mandate of Article 21 read with Article 48A of the Directive Principles of the State Policy and Article 51A(g) of the Fundamental Duties enlisted under Chapter IVA of the Constitution of India. Further, the said Regulations are consistent with the International obligations of India, as India has ratified to the Kyoto Protocol.",Decided,['India>Supreme Court'],"['Suits against governments>Energy and power', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other']","['India>The Electricity Act 2003', 'India>The National Electricity Policy 2005', 'India>The Tariff Policy 2006']",Promoting renewable sources of energy (green power) and strengthening renewable energy market.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/hindustan-zinc-ltd-v-rajasthan-electricity-regulatory-commission/
Rajiv Dutta v. Union of India,"In 2016, the petitioner, a senior environmental lawyer, filed a case before the NGT. The case relates to large scale and uncontrolled forest fires ravaging the States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh thereby undermining the ecological sustainability of an already endangered biological zone. Emissions released by forest fires include carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), organic aerosols and black carbon, non-methane organic compounds, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). These emissions affect the efficiency of both atmospheric and surface absorption of solar energy, with resultant cooling and or warming effects. Forest fires have a devastating effect on the glaciers of Uttarakhand, which are the life line of major north Indian rivers, have been covered by black carbon causing them to melt faster. The respondents, States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, contended that the year 2016 saw extremely low rainfall thereby causing a serious moisture deficit in the soil and in the forest areas, thereby making conditions conducive to the occurrence and spread of forest fires. 

The NGT saw merit in the respondents argument but required a better advance planning and implementation of the Fire Management Plan and Crisis Management plan for forest fires. Accordingly, the NGT directed the central and respective state governments to formulate national policy and guidelines for forest fire prevention and control. The respective States must prepare and implement forest fire management plan for effective prevention and control of forest fire. 

The tribunal specifically asked the Chief secretaries of both the states to ensure that adequate resources and manpower are placed at the disposal of the forest department both at the state and district/division level, at the beginning of each financial year. Consequently, both the States developed their respective plans but the implementation was partial being limited by staff and financial constraints. In 2019, the NGT issued interim orders directing robust institutional mechanism for an effective implementation of the action plans for controlling forest fires.",Decided,['India>National Green Tribunal'],['Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems'],[],"Emissions from forest fires contribute to climate change, and the need to develop forest fire management plans.

Society for Protection of Environment &amp; Biodiversity v. Union of India,"In 2016, the applicant, an environmental society, filed a case before the NGT raising objections to the 2016 draft notification that exempts building and construction projects from the environmental clearance requirement. According to the applicant, the unregulated building and construction activities would cause irreversible damage to the environment, thereby having serious repercussions on climate change. This exemption is also in derogation of Indias international commitments to the Rio Declaration 1992 and Paris Agreement 2015, especially when read in the light of the precautionary principle. The respondent, Ministry of Environment and Forests, contended that the draft notification is a policy decision taken by the Government of India to provide affordable housing to the weaker section of the society under the Housing for All by 2022 scheme. The NGT, exercising its jurisdiction, upheld the applicants contention. The 2016 draft notification considerably dilutes the regime of environmental clearance in building and construction activities, thereby, leading to severe environmental impacts. The principle of non-regression, an accepted norm in international environmental law, mandates that environmental law should not be modified to the detriment of environmental protection.

Accordingly, the NGT declared illegal those parts of a government draft notification that exempted specific building and construction projects from the environmental clearance requirement. Domestically, the construction sector emits 22% of Indias total annual carbon-dioxide emission and has a significant energy footprint. In the name of ease of doing responsible business, the government ignored environmental impacts that have a direct bearing on environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development. Environmental clearances, as a part of the precautionary approach, require the drafting of an EIA report.

The EIA report evaluates carbon emissions associated with the construction project, its adverse impact on the environment, and best practice strategies to reduce these emissions. This helps in achieving the ambitious targets and is directly linked to the climate change and SDGs.",Decided,['India>National Green Tribunal'],['Suits against governments'],['India>Environmental Impact Assessment Regulation 2006'],Quashing those parts of EIA regulation that exempt construction sector from environmental clearance.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/society-for-protection-of-environment-biodiversity-v-union-of-india/
Sukhdev Vihar Welfare Residents Association v. Union of India,"In 2013, the applicants, a welfare residents association, challenged the construction and operation of the waste-to-energy plant by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). The plant to be established in a densely populated residential area would be dangerous to the lives of the residents. The incineration of unsegregated municipal solid waste emits large quantities of GHG, including carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides thereby contributing to global climate change. They are also a large source of indirect GHG, including carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide. The incinerator also emits more CO2 per MW/hour than any fossil fuel- based power source including coal/fuel power plants. The respondents, MCD, argued that the plant is a state- of-the-art facility and offers a clean, efficient and effective alternative to dumping of municipal solid waste in landfill sites. It is in the public interest that the plant operate.

On February 2, 2017, the NGT, however, allowed the operation of the plant. The need of the hour is to ensure processing of the municipal waste with least residue by recourse to developed and tested technologies. Examining public health and interest in conjunction with environmental protection, the balance tilts in favor of permitting the plant to continue its operation of processing the municipal solid waste from waste to energy. The applicability of precautionary principle through monitoring and adherence to stringent standards would ensure that there are no adverse impacts on public health and environment.

Importantly, the NGT observed that the plant in question has been developed as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project. CDM projects, as registered with UNFCCC, are projects that adopt precision in technology that take care of environmental issues as per the international standards including stoppage of generation of GHG emissions. They are considered to be environment friendly, and are thus eligible for carbon credit.

According to the tribunal, the project proponent adopted anti-pollution measures, improved technology, introduced new mechanism for segregation and brought emissions not only within the prescribed limits but even to the more stringent standards imposed by the regulatory authorities. Based on the scientific evidence and inspection reports, the waste-to-energy plant was permitted to operate.",Decided,['India>National Green Tribunal'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],[],Operating waste-to-energy plant in a densely populated area leads to GHG emissions.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/sukhdev-vihar-welfare-residents-association-v-union-of-india/
Carbonext Tecnologia em Solucoes Ambientais Ltda. v. Amazon Imoveis (Voluntary Carbon Market),"Carbonext is a company dedicated to the preservation of the Amazon, working in the development and implementation of carbon credit projects (REDD+, Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation), whose objective is to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and prevent deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.   Individuals and companies can purchase these assets' carbon credits on the voluntary market to offset GHG emissions. Carbonext acquires carbon credits from projects it manages or from assets purchased from other companies and resells them to finance environmental preservation and the development of local communities in the Amazon. The amounts obtained through the purchase and sale of carbon credits fund the environmental preservation and development of local communities in the Amazon Forest. Amazon Imoveis owns 3% of the carbon credits generated by the REDD+ project called The Envira Amazonia Project  A Tropical Forest Conservation Project in Acre, Brazil. 

Carbonext and Amazon Imoveis made a contract for the purchase of carbon credits. Amazon Imoveis promised to sell and transfer 331,080 carbon credits. Carbonext paid the price by December 31, 2021. The debtor had to transfer the assets within up to five business days, counted from the signing of the contract on February 26, 2021. In line with market practice, Carbonext requested the transfer of carbon credits as it sold to companies interested in neutralizing GHG emissions. Initially, Amazon Imoveis transferred 5,000 credits to the claimant, referring to the 2017 harvest. In April 2017,  Carbonext asked Amazon Imoveis to transfer 16,990 units of carbon credits, which they denied. Carbonext sent a pre-judicial letter requesting the transfer of credits, which was not complied with.

On July 12, 2021, Carbonext filed a lawsuit to execute the contractual obligation under the Civil Procedure Code (Federal Law 13,105/2015). The plaintiff requires the (i) transfer of 326,080 carbon credits by Amazon Imoveis to Carbonext within five business days and (ii) for the court to set up a daily fine if the transfer of credits is not done.  

On July 13, 2021, the court of first instance issued an official decision to warn the debtor to satisfy the obligation within fifteen days, under penalty of a daily fine. However, Amazon Imoveis did not fulfill the court order as it started judicial proceedings questioning the debt (motion to stay in execution, autonomous action no. 1088560-57.2021.8.26.0100 and interlocutory appeal with a request for preliminary injunction no. 2180421-19.2021.8.26.0000. The plaintiff requested the carbon credits' custodian, Carbonfund.org Foundation, to transfer the credits from Amazon Imoveis to the creditor, which was accepted by the court and complied with by Carbonfound. However, given non-compliance with the decision, Carbonext requested the payment of the amount related to the daily fine. Amazon Imoveis later informed the court that it had fully complied with the contractual obligations. Accordingly, the court extinguished the process on October 7, 2021, precluding the right to appeal for lack of procedural interest.

Amazon Imoveis later filed a motion alleging that (i) the court's sentence extinguishes the process without giving the appellant/executed party an opportunity to express their views regarding information brought by the appellee/executioner in its petitions; (ii) the fine established in the injunction was not confirmed in the sentence, therefore, it is not enforceable; and (iii) the deduction of the price by the appellant/executioner is improper. It requires a new integrative/clarifying pronouncement to remedy the ambiguity and annul the appealed judgment. This motion is still pending.

Federal Public Ministry v. Ricardo Salles and the Federal Government (Administrative Misconduct Action),"Contestation February 9, 2021.
Petition on July 6, 2020.  

This is a Civil Action of Administrative Misconduct, with a request for precautionary removal from the position, in which the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) claims the practice of intentional acts that violate the constitutional duty of protecting the environment by the Minister of the Environment, Ricardo Salles at the time. It indicates that the former Minister, through actions, omissions, practices and speeches, would have promoted the disruption of environmental policies and the emptying of legal precepts, by favoring interests that have no relation to the purpose of the Ministry, in violation of to the constitutional principles that guide Public Administration. 

The MPF raises a wide range of acts by the ex-minister that would have contributed to the willful disruption of structures for environmental protection, based on four axes: (i) regulatory disruption; (ii) disruption of transparency and participation bodies; (iii) budget disruption; and (iv) supervisory disruption. Regarding regulatory disruption, it indicates four normative acts considered illegal and abusive: Decree 10,347/2020, which transferred the granting power of public forests from the Ministry of the Environment (MMA) to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply (MAPA); the MMA Order 4.410/2020, which allowed the regularization of illegal deforestation in a permanent preservation area in the Atlantic Forest biome; Decree 9,672/2019, which extinguished the Secretariat for Climate Change and Forests; and Joint Ordinance 298/2019, which changed the composition of the Federal Environmental Compensation Committee. 

The argument related to climate is highlighted in the discussion regarding the extinction of the Secretariat of Climate Change and Forests, which acted in the fight against climate change and actions that generate a potential imbalance in the planet's ecosystem, claiming the MPF that such an act would signal that the matter would not be a priority of the federal government. In this sense, it emphasizes that there was no resizing of the theme, having practically disappeared from the structure of the Ministry. It states that this would distance Brazil from efforts to comply with international climate commitments assumed under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), especially in the Copenhagen Accord (2009) and the Paris Agreement (2015), promulgated by Federal Decree 9,073/2017, and internal within the scope of the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). 

As for the disruption of transparency and participation bodies, it claims the reduction of civil society participation in the National Council for the Environment (CONAMA), the removal of information from the MMA's official website, interference in the dissemination of deforestation data by the National Research Institute (INPE) and the restriction of information related to the activities of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio). 

As for the budget breakdown, it questions the reduction of budgetary resources destined to IBAMA and the inactivation of the Amazon Fund due to the extinction of Organs operational and guiding bodies. It is noteworthy that, regarding the stoppage of the Amazon Fund, dedicated to financing REDD+ actions linked to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, the MPF mentions the relationship of the stoppage with the lack of funding and implementation of the Prevention Plan and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), provided for in the PNMC. The increase in deforestation and the absence of actions on the part of the Ministry to combat it are associated, once again, with the failure to comply with climate commitments and deforestation reduction targets provided for in the PNMC, UNFCCC, Paris Agreement and Copenhagen Agreement. 

As for the supervisory disruption, it states that the former Minister, through his actions, would be contributing to making the performance of career servants unfeasible, especially relevant in a context of increased deforestation. Given this broad framework of disruption of the protection of the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment, the MPF requested, as an injunction, the precautionary removal of Ricardo Salles from the position of Minister of the Environment, presenting a definitive request that the acts mentioned be declared unprofessional in a condemning him to the loss of public service. There was a decision of the judge in the first instance denying the preliminary injunction. 

In response, the Federal Union manifested itself, denying the existence of any illicit act on the part of former minister Ricardo Salles. It alleges the principle of separation of powers, asserting the inappropriateness of demanding a decision from the judiciary on the choice of the Chief Executive of the federal branch regarding the appointment of public positions of trust. It states that there is no legal obstacle to the various acts imputed, in the case of decisions of administrative merit, within the scope of the public manager's powers to direct public policies, carried out in accordance with the environmental agenda and in compliance with the laws and the Constitution. It argues that there is no need to talk about the practice of an act of improbity, stressing that the damage to the environment attributed to the defendant, especially the increase in deforestation, occurs due to several factors that are distant and unrelated to the personal acts carried out by a Minister of State.",Pending,['Brazil>Federal District'],[],"['Brazil>Federal Constitution', 'Brazil>PNMC (Federal Law 12 187/2009)', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Brazil>National Environmental Policy Act (Law No. 6.938 of 1981)', 'Brazil>Forest Code (Law No. 4771 of 1965)']",,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=17027

This is a Petition for the investigation of a political-administrative infraction that gives rise to a crime of responsibility, denounced by Fabiano Contarato, Randolph Frederich Rodrigues Alves and Joenia Batista de Carvalho, federal parliamentarians, against Ricardo Salles, then Minister of the Environment. 

The applicants maintain that the public management of the accused, at the head of the portfolio, proved to be incompatible with the probity and decorum imposed on the directors of the position. They report, among other decisions and reputed undignified omissions, the violation of international commitments, ratified by the Brazilian government, to combat climate change, especially the Paris Agreement. They suggest that the ministerial policy implemented by the accused was not proactive in achieving the Brazilian goals for the reduction of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). In this context, they point to a lack of commitment to combating illegal deforestation in the Amazon Forest, exposing protective public policies to risk. They also emphasize the existence of IBAMA budget cuts, compromising inspection actions. Finally, they require the recognition of the practice, by the then Minister of State for the Environment, of a crime of responsibility, being imposed the penalty of loss of office, as well as disqualification from holding public office for eight years.

The Rapporteur Minister, in a monocratic decision, understood the lack of legitimacy of the applicants, determining the filing of the action. The requesting party then filed an Interlocutory Appeal, in which it repeated the terms of the Petition, noting that its legitimacy is supported by art. 14 of the Crimes of Responsibility Law (Law 1079/1950), which, according to what was narrated, gives legitimacy to any citizen to denounce the Minister of State.

Judgment March 17, 2021. 
Judgment on March 17, 2021. 
Decision on December 4, 2020. 
Petition on October 26, 2020. 

This is a lawsuit filed as an Ordinary Action, with a request for injunctive relief, by Flexpetro Distribuidora de Derivados de Petroleo Ltda. in the face of the ANP and the Federal Union aiming to move away from the goal of acquiring Decarbonization Credits (CBios) for the plaintiff company. 

CBios were established by the National Biofuels Policy (Federal Law 13.576/2017), known as RenovaBio. The Policy, among other objectives, seeks to contribute to the fulfillment of the commitments assumed by Brazil under the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9,073/2017), to promote the expansion of biofuels in the energy matrix and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions Greenhouse (GHG) in the production, commercialization and use of biofuels. To this end, the main instrument is the establishment of annual national decarbonization targets for the fuel sector, which are, each year, individualized for fuel distributors and fulfilled by companies through the acquisition of CBios available on the Stock Exchange. (B3), under penalty of sanctions provided for in the Law. The annual reduction targets are set by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). The individual goals are indicated by the ANP. CBios are issued by biofuel producers or exporters authorized by the ANP, and the issuance of these assets by all of them is not mandatory. 

The plaintiff company alleges that, when establishing the decarbonization targets in June and July 2019 (referring to the year 2019 and the decade 2020-2029), the ANP acted in disagreement with the RenovaBio Law, since it published them without any parameter. about the availability of CBios in the market and without the regulation of the certification process of these assets. It should be noted that, in December 2019, the ANP established the procedures for generating the necessary ballast for the CBios and that the platform for trading the assets only came into operation in April 2020. It adds that, when establishing the CBios acquisition targets that fuel distributors should achieve in 2020, the ANP failed to observe the availability of assets in the market, with no certainty as to the availability sufficient for the company to meet its stipulated target. 

It argues that this situation had an impact on asset prices, making it impossible to meet the target established by the ANP for the year 2020. It claims that the ANP resolutions and orders established to regulate the subject are illegal, since they failed to observe the provided for by the RenovaBio Law, which determines the establishment of possible and viable goals. The plaintiff company requests, in an injunction, the immediate suspension of its compulsory target stipulated from several ANP Orders of 2019 and 2020, regarding the acquisition of CBios, and that the application of fines and sanctions as a result of the non-acquisition of CBios, in relation to the plaintiff. On the merits, it requires (i) the recognition of the illegality of the CNPE Resolutions, as well as the ANP Dispatches, for contradicting the provisions of the RenovaBio Law by establishing the mandatory targets to be achieved by fuel distributors, or even the nullity of the act administrative, as it lacks legal support and, as a consequence, (ii) that the plaintiff is not compelled to acquire the CBios, as well as the application of fines, sanctions and penalties by the ANP to the plaintiff company as a result of the non-acquisition of the credits. 

A decision was rendered that considered the probability of the right present, since the existence of obstacles to the regular fulfillment of the established goals was demonstrated, as well as the fear of irreparable damage or difficult to repair due to the concrete possibility of the plaintiff company being penalized with fines or sanctions for non-compliance with the targets set. Therefore, it granted the anticipation of the effects of the injunction to determine the suspension of the compulsory goal stipulated to the plaintiff company regarding the acquisition of CBios, as well as for the defendants to refrain from imposing fines and/or sanctions due to non-compliance with this goal, until further decision. 

Subsequently, the decision was revoked due to the judgment of Interlocutory Appeal 5059210-44.2020.4.04.0000 filed by the ANP. The appeal was provided under the terms of the decision of the Judge-Rapporteur, who based it on the following main points: (i) the mandatory annual targets for decarbonization and acquisition of CBios for the year 2020 were known to fuel distributors since 2018; (ii) in 2020 there was only a 50% reduction in the year's target, which was for the benefit of the distributors; (iii) the claim that the deadline for meeting individual targets is short is not valid, as the acts that set them were already in full force and the offer of CBios was already present at reduced prices; (iv) maintaining the decision under review could give rise to unfair competition between the distribution companies; (v) no illegality is observed in the CNPE resolutions or ANP orders related to compulsory targets; and (vi) it is not up to the Judiciary to reassess the criteria adopted by the Public Administration in the case, since there is no illegality. 

In response, the Federal Government claims that the object has been lost, given that the plaintiff was not successful in the request for provisional injunction, with the goals stipulated for the period being maintained, and before the expiry of the proof period (until the 31st/ 12/2020), the present demand is no longer useful. On the merits, it defends: (i) the propositional competence of the CNPE to set annual decarbonization targets; (ii) that the creation of CBios is in line with environmental rules, constituting CBios an economic instrument aimed at protecting the environment and providing quality of life for present and future generations, especially in view of the reduction of pollutant emissions; (iii) the absence of delay in the disclosure of annual targets; (iv) the validity, timeliness and legitimacy of the rules that regulate the CBios; (v) that there was sufficient time for the acquisition of CBios and their full availability in the market; (vi) that any granting of the initial requests negatively interferes with the fulfillment of international carbon emission reduction agreements; and (vii) that the claim contained in the initial constitutes interference by the Judiciary in the performance of the Executive Power. 

A decision was handed down that dismissed the request, on the following main grounds: (i) CNPE Resolution 15/2019 exceptionally granted the possibility that the 2019 target, effective as of December 24, could be proven in the year 2020, cumulatively with the target for the following year and in proportion to the number of days it is in effect; (ii) the fact that the CBios trading platform started operating in mid-2020 did not affect the acquisition of credits by companies in the sector, as disclosed by the ANP, with most companies fully meeting the set target; and (iii) in accordance with the jurisprudence that has understood the mandatory targets set to be legitimate and reasonable, it has understood that it is not up to the Judiciary to reassess the criteria adopted by the Public Administration.",Pending,['Brazil>Parana (PR)'],[],"['Brazil>ANP Resolution 791/2019', 'Brazil>CNPE Resolution 08/2020', 'Brazil>CNPE Resolution 15/2019', 'Brazil>Decree 9 888/2019 (provides for the definition of mandatory annual targets to reduce GHG emissions for the commercialization of fuels and institutes the National Biofuels Policy Committee)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution', 'Brazil>National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio)', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",  ,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=17034

This is an action filed as an Ordinary Action, with a request for injunctive relief, by Biostratum Distribuidora de Combustiveis SA against the Federal Government, aiming at the removal of the mandatory target for the acquisition of Decarbonization Credits (CBios) that was imposed on it, equivalent to 9,959 CBios until the share distribution. 

The CBios were established by the National Biofuels Policy (Federal Law 13.576/2017) - known as RenovaBio - which, in turn, was enacted because Brazil is a signatory to the Paris Agreement. Renovabio, among other objectives, aims to contribute to the fulfillment of the commitments assumed by the country under the Paris Agreement, to promote the expansion of biofuels in the energy matrix and the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions in the production, commercialization and use of biofuels. To this end, it provides for the establishment of annual national decarbonization targets for the fuel sector, which are, each year, individualized for fuel distributors and fulfilled by companies through the acquisition of CBios, under penalty of sanctions provided for in the Law. Annual targets are defined by the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE), and are individualized by the National Agency for Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels (ANP). 

The plaintiff company alleges that the obligation to acquire CBios sets the imposition of a new tax, with the Decarbonization Credit being a residual tax, as it is not provided for in the Federal Constitution and for meeting the requirements set out in the National Tax Code (Federal Law 5.172/1966). It claims that, for the imposition of such a tax, the Federal Constitution requires that a Complementary Law be issued and that the tax be non-cumulative, which does not occur in the case of CBios, implying a formal defect in its institution. 

The author also adds that, as a fuel distributor, it is not responsible for the emission of polluting gases, but only for the commercialization of fossil fuels, and it is logical that the fuel producer was the recipient of the compulsory purchase of CBios. It also states that the distribution of fuels is a low-polluting activity. It requests, in an injunction, the suspension of its CBios acquisition target. Finally, it requires the confirmation of the guardianship request and the recognition of the unconstitutionality of the legislation that determines the institution of the compulsory target to the company for the acquisition of CBios. 

The preliminary injunction was rejected, on the main grounds that (i) the constitutional principles for the protection of the environment set out in the Federal Constitution entail the obligation to reduce the environmental impact of human conduct, whether in the production or distribution of fossil fuels; (ii) the establishment of CBios acquisition targets does not constitute the creation of a tax norm, but an environmental administrative norm, based on constitutional and international dictates for the reduction of environmental pollution, whose deleterious effects are felt worldwide, such as increasing the heat and decrease in the amount of rain; (iii) the argument that the distribution company does not pollute is not credible. As no matter of a tax nature was recognized in the demand, it was determined the redistribution of the action to the federal court with competence in administrative matters. 

In contestation, the Federal Union defends, among other points: 
(i) that the creation of CBios is in line with environmental rules, functioning as a way of encouraging social actors to preserve nature, with the creation of compensatory measures being essential to the reduction of GHG emissions and for the effectiveness of RenovaBio; 
(ii) that CBios are based on the idea of converting the environmental costs of using fossil fuels into revenue for biofuel producers, offering efficiency incentives for their sustainable growth; 
(iii) that the Decarbonization Credits provide the value of externalities present in the fuel market, generating a competitive balance between fossil and renewable fuels; 
(iv) that CBios are a market solution without changing taxes; 
(v) the absence of delay in the disclosure of annual targets; 
(vi) that there was sufficient time for the acquisition of CBios and their full availability in the market; 
(vii) the absence of a tax legal relationship, especially since it is an obligation to reduce GHG emissions, through the acquisition of CBios offered by other private parties, with no pecuniary relationship between the Public Administration and the distributor; and 
(viii) the impossibility of moving away from the mandatory annual target of decarbonization and acquisition of CBios by the distributors.

The decision at first instance dismissed the requests, on the same grounds as the decision that rejected the request for preliminary injunction requested in the initial, confirming it. The plaintiff filed an appeal, arguing, in addition to the arguments presented in the initial petition, that the imposition of the acquisition of CBios to fuel distributors hinders the activity of the economic sector, violating the principle of Free Enterprise. The Federal Union presented counterarguments to the appeal, requesting the maintenance of the sentence, in the same terms presented in the answer.

"ISA, ABRAMPA and Greenpeace v. Brazil","This is a Public Civil Action, with an injunction, filed by ISA, ABRAMPA and Greenpeace Brasil, against IBAMA and the Federal Union, in order to determine the nullity of IBAMA's Interpretative Order 7036900/2020, which waived the need to authorization, issued by the Agency, for the export of wood products and by-products of native species. According to the previous regulation, the person interested in obtaining the export authorization of wood products would have to present, in person, at the IBAMA unit that controls the customs warehouse, a series of documents proving the legality of the goods, submitting them to inspection and release. The plaintiffs, when challenging the order, argued that the request (only) of the Document of Forest Origin (DOF) is unsatisfactory for the correct inspection, monitoring and control of wood exports. The plaintiffs explained that the composition of the DOF is based on data entered by the interested parties themselves, and not by IBAMA, and that the Agency would not be able to intervene before the shipment of cargoes goes abroad. 

The plaintiffs suggests that this change is part of the deconstruction of environmental public policy in Brazil, to the detriment of protective legislation. This relate to the risk of a higher incidence of illegal deforestation, especially in the Amazon, with the new order. The plaintiffs explain the relationship between the increase in deforestation and climate change, in particular the Brazilian scenario of high GHG emissions, derived from changes in land use, and the loss of carbon sinks, resulting from the suppression of native vegetation, in addition to its deleterious effects on tropical forests, with changes in the rainy season and an increase in the risk of reaching the ""point of no return"" of devastation of the Amazon Forest. In this sense, the plaintiffs request, in an injunction, that the suspension of the effects of Interpretative Order 7036900/2020 be determined, which waived the need for authorization for the export of wood products and by-products of native species and, definitively, requires if its nullity is determined, combined with the obligation to take all necessary measures to restore the effects of the previous regulation, regarding the requirement of authorization for the export of native wood.

Public Ministry of the State of Rio Grande do Sul vs. State of Rio Grande do Sul and FEPAM (Carbochemical Complex),"On November 12, 2019, the Rio Grande do Sul Public Prosecutors Office (MPRS) filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) against the State of Rio Grande do Sul and the State Environmental Agency (Fundacao Estadual de Protecao Ambiental Henrique Luis Roessler  FEPAM). It seeks to prevent the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Complex in the State as well as the State Policy on Mineral Coal. The MPRS questions the lack of popular participation, especially through public hearings, in the legislative process of State Law 15.047/2017, which authorized the construction of the Carbon Chemical Pole and created the State Policy for Mineral Coal. In addition, it argues that there should be a prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIS) for the implementation of the Pole, considering the climate impacts of the activities on the site, which will be placed in the complexes of Baixo Jacui and Campanha, and a Strategic Environmental Assessment before its institution, which must consider the synergistic and global effects of all the activities. The author adds that the policy encourages the use of a highly impactful energy matrix regarding the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). The MPRS emphasizes the proximity of the carbon-chemical complexes to protected areas and cities. The author alleges that the implementation of the Pole considers only the EIS specific to the Guaiba Mine, not taking into account the entire complex. It argues that the State Law does not consider, among other issues, environmental protection, at odds with the federal and state legislation on climate change. The granting of an injunction is required to prevent, among other measures, (i) the implementation of the State Policy on Mineral Coal and the establishment of the Pole and (ii) the issuance of an environmental license for an enterprise inserted in complexes, up to the realization of public hearings and the development of an EIS and a Strategic Environmental Assessment, prior to the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Pole and the State Policy on Mineral. On a definitive basis, the author requires the confirmation of preliminary injunctions to declare the illegality of the legislative process that led to the State Law. 

Subsequently, the legal action 9019860-68.2020.8.21.0001, filed by Arayara Association of Education and Culture and by the Colony of Fishermen Z-5, was reunited to this lawsuit due to the connection between the demands.

ABRAGET vs. State of Rio de Janeiro (Decree on Energy Compensation Mechanism),"On August 12, 2013, ABRAGET filed a claim with a request for an injunction against the State of Rio de Janeiro. The plaintiff challenges State Decree 41,318/2008, which establishes the Energy Compensation Mechanism (ECM) as part of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Abatement Plan, in order to combat global warming and strengthen the energy supply in the State. 

The decree imposes conditions for obtaining environmental permitting aimed specifically at companies in the energy sector based on fossil fuels, at the state level. The plaintiff states that the planned changes would demand high financial costs, excessively burdening the associated plants. It alleges a breach of the federal government's competence to legislate on electric energy. It further argues that the decree is unconstitutional due to a lack of a previous law to be regulated. It also adds a request for suspension of the effectiveness of the decree. This is based on the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), which, as argued by the plaintiffs, supervened the decree, emphasizing that the national law does not establish any compensation for the energy sector. It clarifies that Brazil has internalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Decree 2652/1998), but has made a reservation regarding Annex I, so that it is outside the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ABRAGET argues that the mitigation commitment provided for in the PNMC is voluntary, and not linked to the environmental permitting process. It requests (i) the granting of anticipation of the effects to suspend the effects of the decree and (i) at the end, the judicial determination for the State of Rio de Janeiro to refrain from enforcing Decree 41.318/2008. 

In response, the defendant State pointed out on November 29, 2013 that the energy compensation mechanism was edited to mitigate and compensate for the scientifically unequivocal adverse environmental effects of energy production. It emphasized the common competence of the federative entities for the adoption of environmental protective measures, and that the member state observed the precautionary principle. The state argued that as thermoelectric plants are more polluting, the discrimination adopted by the State is in accordance with the reality of the facts, and the measure is proportional. The state argued that the decree was not incompatible with the PNMC. Finally, among other issues, it defended the legality and constitutionality of the decree and requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's request. 

On March 6, 2015, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff's request, emphasizing that the judiciary, when carrying out control of public policies, must honor the purposes of the state, given that the decree contributes to the intergenerational maintenance of a healthy environment. The plaintiff appealed reaffirming the points of the initial petition and requested the annulment of the decision. On February 7, 2017, the appellate court considered the evidence of decree's unconstitutionality to be strong, raising an incident of unconstitutionality to be resolved before the Court's Special Body. 

On September 12, 2017, within the scope of the claim of unconstitutionality, the Court's Special Body decided for the validity of the decree, emphasizing, among other issues, that it is an activity inherent to the environmental administrative function with a view to materializing protective measures for the environment. After the decision, the plaintiff stated that the discussion on the application of the decree to ABRAGET's associates remained. A decision was handed down stating that the appellant's claim - to determine the non-application of Decree 41.318/08 to its associates - is generic, not being possible to fulfill the request. In addition, the court stated that any assessment of the improper application of conditions to the contracts in force should be carried out in a separate action. Therefore, the author's appeal was dismissed. 

Subsequently, ABRAGET filed an Extraordinary Appeal, which was held inadmissible. The plaintiff filed an appeal to the Federal Supreme Court (STF). On August 7, 2018, within the scope of the Extraordinary Appeal (ARE 1.317.221/RJ), the Justice, in a monocratic decision, held that the Court has consolidated jurisprudence on the concurrent competence between the federated entities to legislate on environmental protection. Since it would be necessary to go through the factual-evidence review and the interpretation of local legislation to verify that the decree refers to environmental protection standards, and not electricity, it could not hear the case. 

The plaintiffs further filed an Interlocutory Appeal, which was denied by the 2nd Panel of the Court.

ADPF 746 (Fires in the Pantanal and the Amazon Forest),"On September 24, 2020, an Allegation of Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF), with a request for an injunction, was filed by the Labor Party (PT) due to the omission of the Federal Executive Branch regarding the duties of protection, prevention, precaution, inspection, conservation, surveillance and sustainability of the environment and, in particular, with regard to its action against fires that affected the Pantanal ecosystem and the Amazon Forest, emphasizing that this scenario affects climate change. The case highlights the economic and social impacts of the fires, especially for the native communities of the Pantanal, as well as the impacts of fires on the health of animals and the population, even more aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs state that there are risks for future generations, considering that the environmental effects, especially on the climate, are gradual. In addition, it points to violations of human dignity and rights to health, life and an ecologically balanced environment, as well as a lack of commitment to addressing the climate issue. It highlights that the quilombola, riverside and indigenous populations are the most directly affected. It therefore alleges structural failure in the environmental protection system. 

In an injunction, the plaintiff requires 
(i) the adoption of operational efforts to combat fires in the Pantanal and the Amazon Forest, especially in order to restructure the National System for the Prevention and Combat of Forest Fires (PREVFOGO) and to implement an Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), in addition to the creation of action plans similar to other Brazilian biomes, 
(ii) the institution of an integrated public health and veterinary medical treatment project, 
(iv) the creation of a multidisciplinary commission to serve as an observatory of these measures and 
(v) the Ministry of the Environment's explanation of the budget execution of environmental protection programs in 2019 and 2020. 

On the merits, it requires recognition of the unconstitutionality of part of the environmental policy of the current Federal Executive Branch due to omissions in the face of incidents of devastation of biomes, confirming the preliminary injunctions.

Conectas Direitos Humanos v. BNDES and BNDESPAR,"On June 21, 2022, Conectas Direitos Humanos filed a claim against BNDES  (Brazil's  Development  Bank) and BNDESPar, the bank's investment arm responsible for managing its shareholdings in various Brazilian companies held by the bank. According to Conectas, this is the world's first civil climate  action against a national development bank. Although BNDESPar, which is publicly owned, follows an Environmental and Social Policy for Operating in Capital Markets, which bans support for companies with a track record of environmental crimes and modern-day slavery, this policy does not include climate criteria. The company also does not report the carbon emissions associated with its investment portfolio and still maintains equity positions in sectors that are among the most carbon-intensive in the Brazilian economy. The lack of rules or protocols for assessing the impacts of its investments on the climate crisis are in violation of the Brazil's commitments under the Paris Agreement and the countrys own PNMC (National Policy on Climate Change), among other provisions. 

Based on two technical opinions, Conectas asks the court to require BNDESPar and its controller, BNDES, to be given 90 days to adopt transparency measures and present a plan with rules and mechanisms to commit their investments and divestments to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the companies they finance. In practice, these actions will affect the just transition and guarantee the country's readjustment in the world economy towards sustainable development, which would be the institutional mission of BNDES itself. The plan should align with commitments to reducing GHG emissions by 2030 in the sectors currently financed by the company, in accordance with the international commitments assumed by Brazil. In addition to presenting concrete goals, the plan should be prepared together with civil society, public bodies and academics, and it should provide for environmental and social compensation whenever the targets are not achieved. The case also calls for the creation by BNDESPar of a Climate Situation Room to assess compliance with the targets established in the plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, while publishing the progress or setbacks in the sectors that have investments from BNDESPar. One of the requests made in the case is for the Room to be accessed by representatives of civil society, traditional peoples and communities, the Public Prosecutors Office, the Public Defenders Office, academics and members of the Judiciary.

Federal Public Ministry vs. Federal Union and others ( hotspotsdeforestation in the Amazon),"This is a Public Civil Action filed by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) against the Federal Union, IBAMA, ICMBio and FUNAI, preceded by a request for provisional urgent relief in an antecedent nature. The immediate implementation of command and control actions is sought to contain environmental violators at least in the top ten hotspotsof environmental illicit activities in the Amazon. 

The lawsuit questions (i) the growing deforestation curve in the biome, which demonstrates the failure to comply with the measures provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and in the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon Legal Framework (PPCDAm), which aims to fulfill the commitments assumed by Brazil in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Federal Decree 2,652/1998), in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9,073 /2017) and the Copenhagen Accord, whose goals were incorporated by the PNMC; and (ii) the uncontrolled spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus - related to the COVID-19 pandemic - through the forest, especially putting at risk the most vulnerable Amazonian populations, such as indigenous peoples, riverine people, quilombolas, extractivists, rubber tappers and small farmers , as well as urban populations.

ADI 6932 (Eletrobras Privatization),"In July 15, 2021, several political parties (PSB, PSOL, Rede, PT, PDT and PCdoB) filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality, with a request for precautionary measures, in the Brazilian Supreme Court. The action challenges Law 14.182/2021, which deals with the privatization of the national electricity company Eletrobras and promotes changes in the Brazilian electricity sector regime. The law derived from a provisional measure, which can only be adopted in exceptional circumstances. The plaintiffs argue that the provisional measure, which was then turned into the law in question, lacked the requirement of urgency, circumventing the regular legislative process. They claim that, when considering the conversion of the provisional measure, the National Congress approved amendments that resulted in substantial changes to Brazilian energy planning. The final wording of the provisions reveals an undue attempt to prevent a possible veto by the President of the Republic. The Law, under the terms approved, requires the mandatory contracting of energy from small hydroelectric power plants and natural gas thermoelectric plants. The plaintiffs argue that such a requirement makes the necessary decarbonization of the Brazilian energy matrix more distant and will lead to an increase in annual greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), in breach of the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and by the President of the Republic at COP26. The plaintiffs point out that the enactment of the Law violates the legal and constitutional order since it is contrary to the duty to act in favor of the protection of intact and stable climatic conditions. The Law also authorizes the Federal Union to start the construction of the Linhao de Tucurui (transmission line), disregarding the administrative processes of environmental permitting and consultation and affecting indigenous groups. 

The plaintiffs request (i) that a precautionary measure be granted to determine the immediate suspension of the effectiveness of Law 14.182/2021 or, alternatively, the suspension of specific articles and, (ii) on the merits, that said law be declared unconstitutional in its entirety or, alternatively, the unconstitutionality of specific articles.

Federal Public Ministry vs. Federal Union (Zoning of Sugar Cane),"On December 12, 2019, the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) filed a public civil action, with a request for urgent relief, to hold the Federal Union responsible for issuing a presidential decree (no. 10.084/2019, which revoked Decree 6.961/2009) approving the agroecological zoning of sugarcane and requesting the National Monetary Council to establish norms for financing activities in the sugar-alcohol sector. The plaintiff alleges that, when editing the new Decree, the Union did not present technical or political reasons for the repeal of the previous rule. Furthermore, the decree can cause irreversible environmental damage to the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services produced by the forest, which implies potential national and global impacts, especially regarding the service of climate regulation and rain distribution. The plaintiff argues that the decree can make it difficult to demonstrate compliance with the goals of the Paris Agreement. 

The investigations that gave rise to the lawsuit were carried out in a civil inquiry that aimed to determine the legality of the release of sugarcane plantations in the Amazon, in the face of possible environmental damage resulting from the activity and the failure to adopt mitigating measures. The investigation arose out of a complaint by a researcher, based on scientific studies published in the journal Science, which demonstrated the economic and environmental consequences of allowing sugarcane cultivation in the Amazon and Pantanal biomes. The plaintiff request a granting a preliminary injunction for (i) the court to suspend the effects of Decree 10,084/2019, resuming the previous one, and (ii) that the Union refrain from issuing a new decree on this matter until it demonstrates, through technical and scientific studies, the plausibility of the measure in comparison with the duty to protect the environment. The plaintiff also requires, in a final request, to condemn the Union for material and collective moral damages. 

On February 29, 2020, the Federal Government replied and (i) defended the legality and constitutionality of Decree 10,084/2019, claiming that the new decree is in accordance with the provisions of the RenovaBio program and with new production techniques, and Brazil must double production and use of ethanol as automotive fuel to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, (ii) that the practice disciplined by the new decree must observe the environmental legal framework, especially environmental licensing, and (iii) the absence of objective responsibility of the State in reason due to lack of proof of damage. 

On April 20, 20202, the court granted precautionary measures - later partially suspended by Interlocutory Appeal 1012253-37.2020.4.01.0000. The court immediately suspended the effects of Decree 10.084/2019, until the Union proved, within 180 days from the technical studies, the scientific and non-impacting feasibility that motivated the new legislation and the revocation of the previous one for the involved biomes. The appeal refers to the determination of communication by environmental licensing agencies, federal, state and municipal, of the Legal Amazon for the authorization/licensing of sugarcane planting activities in the region to be prohibited.

"Federal Public Ministry vs. State of Sao Paulo, CETESB and IBAMA (Sugar Cane Straw Burning)","This is a Public Civil Action, with a request for preliminary injunction, filed by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) against the State of Sao Paulo, CETESB and IBAMA. The cancellation of all licenses and authorizations issued by the state agency referring to the authorization for the controlled burning of sugarcane straw in the municipalities covered by the Judicial Subsection of Campinas is required, as well as the impediment of the defendants from issuing new licenses without the elaboration of an Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA). 

The objective is for IBAMA to act in a supplementary way in the implementation and inspection of measures to protect the environment, since the responsible state agencies would not be acting satisfactorily. The author claims that this activity implies several damages, such as to the atmosphere  generating pollution and contributing to global warming  to public health, among others, in addition to the fact that the burning of sugarcane straw is a practice repudiated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Change. Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Decree 2652/1998). Finally, the MPF requires that, if there is a request for a licensing of this activity, that it is mandatory to carry out an EIA/RIMA as a condition for the licensing, and the analysis must be comprehensive, taking into account, among other factors, the changes in the atmosphere related to the greenhouse effect and global warming. 

In response, IBAMA alleges, among other issues, (i) its illegitimacy in the defendant's position, since it would not have the competence to carry out such licensing, (ii) that the technical criteria related to the assessment of impacts are acts of technical discretion and (iii) the lack of environmental licensing for the burning of sugarcane straw. The State of Sao Paulo in its defense argues that the sudden stoppage of the sugarcane harvesting system will cause damage to economic and social values that will overcome the impacts on the environment and human health. It identifies the presence of federal and state legislation authorizing the controlled burning of sugarcane straw and that there is state competence to authorize this practice, without the need to prepare an EIA/RIMA. CETESB, in contestation, argues that the authorizations for the controlled burning of sugarcane straw include measures to mitigate the negative impacts of the practice; and the competence of the state agency to issue such authorizations. It also argues that there is no need to prepare an EIA/RIMA to grant authorization for this activity and that the licensing of a sugar and alcohol enterprise covers all activities related to the core activity, such as the planted agricultural area. Finally, he states that the practice respects national and state policies on climate change, as the aim is to mechanize the sugarcane harvest and gradually reduce the practice of burning. 

The lower court decision condemned CETESB and the State of Sao Paulo to abstain from granting new licenses and authorizations that do not include specific licensing with EIA/RIMA and contemplate the consequences of the activity for the atmosphere, global temperature and others; and IBAMA was ordered to inspect the damage caused by the activity of burning sugarcane straw and take steps to prevent the destruction of specimens.

Clara Leonel Ramos and Bruno de Almeida de Lima vs. State of Sao Paulo (Families for the Climate and IncentivAuto Program),"On November 10, 2021, individuals from two global movements that seek to promote climate justice, Families for the Climate and Fridays for Future, filled a Popular Action, with a request for a preliminary injunction, against the State of Sao Paulo, the Governor of the State (Joao Doria) and the Secretary of Finance and Planning (Henrique Meirelles). The plaintiffs question the adequacy of the administrative acts that structure the institutional design of the IncentivAuto Program - Automotive Regime for New Investments to the federal and state rules protecting the climate system, such as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12. 187/2009) and the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 13.798/2009), and the international commitments made by Brazil, especially under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The plaintiffs highlight the lack of transparency of the Program's information, which resulted in the separate filing of the Autonomous Action for the Advance Production of Evidence (No. 1047315-47.2020.8.26.0053). They argue that public policies for social and economic development should be aligned with the mitigation of environmental or climate damage and the preservation of the environment, life, and human health of present and future generations, highlighting the social function of property. They allege that the acts do not bring any requirement for project assessment through socio-environmental parameters that aim at the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions. According to the plaintiffs, the Program finances, with public resources, the increase of emissions, in disagreement with the protective norms of the climate system. Finally, they request, among other things, (i) the granting of injunctive relief determining the suspension of the IncentivAuto Program and, definitively, (ii) the confirmation of the injunction to declare the nullity of the regulations that structure it and of the other administrative acts resulting therefrom; or, alternatively, to determine that the State of Sao Paulo includes, in the Program, conditions for the approval of projects related to the adoption of measures aimed at the reduction of GHG emissions and adaptation to climate impacts.  

On January 12, 2021, a decision was handed down denying the request for preliminary injunction, on the grounds that there is no evidence of the probability of the right, and that it was necessary to produce evidence to determine whether the environmental damage was greater than the economic development goal established. The judge pointed out that the IncentivAuto Program is required to comply with environmental requirements.

In response, the State of Sao Paulo argued, in sum, that the implementation of the IncentivAuto Program stimulates socioeconomic development, thus meeting the public interest for which it was created, and that there is no harm to public property, administrative morality or the environment. The State affirmed that the protection of the environment is not separated from other constitutionally guaranteed rights, being necessary the conciliation with the development values through the principle of sustainable development. The State noted that it has a clean energy matrix and a policy based on several sources of supply, on energy security and efficiency, having already implemented different public policies aimed at the reduction of emissions and pollutants, highlighting the PEMC. In his reply, the Governor of Sao Paulo, Joao Doria, argued his illegitimacy as a respondent and that the plaintiffs cannot question the convenience and opportunity of the legislation, that the intention to suspend the Program violates the principles of discretion and separation of powers. 

On May 22, 2022, the court handed down a sentence in which it dismissed the action. It pointed out that the Program requires compliance with various obligations, including obtaining environmental licenses and complying with the pollutant emission standards of the Vehicle Emission Control Program (PROCONVE), established by CONAMA Resolution 18/1986 and ratified by Federal Law 8.723/1993. The court concluded that there was no harm to the public patrimony, administrative morality, or the environment. Regarding the subsidiary request, it understood that it configures an obligation to do, not being possible to use the Popular Action for this purpose.

BRASILCOM vs. Minister of Mines and Energy (Writ of Mandamus and CBios),"This is a Collective Writ of Mandamus, with a request for an injunction, filed by the Association of Fuel Distributors (BRASILCOM). The association questions the mandatory annual goal of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by fuel distributors for the year 2020, an act that has the Minister of Mines and Energy, in his capacity as President of the National Council of Energy, as binding authority. Energy Policy (CNPE), having been the goal disclosed through CNPE Resolution 8/2020 and individualized for companies through ANP Order 797/2020. The updated annual target, reduced by 50% due to the COVID-19 pandemic, was released by the CNPE on 9/10/2020 and individualized for distribution companies on 9/25/2020, to be met by 12/31/2020 . The mandatory annual goal of reducing GHG emissions is an instrument of the National Biofuels Policy - RenovaBio (Federal Law 13,576/2017), created with a view to meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9,073/2017) and has the purpose of promoting greater participation of biofuels in the national energy matrix, by encouraging energy generation through renewable sources. In order to meet the established annual target, fossil fuel distributors must purchase Biofuel Decarbonization Credits (CBios) on the financial market. The petitioner alleges that the 2020 target is illegal, since, from the publication of the new annual target, the distribution companies would have only 3 months to meet it, arguing that its volume would not be proportional to the time required for the acquisition of CBios . It argues that the amount of CBios available in the market is not enough to meet the annual target, that the increase in demand for the asset generated an overvaluation of its price and that, if fuel distributors do not meet the target, they will be subject to penalties that include suspension activities, and there may be a collapse of the national fuel distribution system. Finally, the petitioner requests (i) the granting of the preliminary injunction so that the CNPE is determined to reduce the new mandatory annual target of the distributors for the year 2020, in proportion to the time available for the acquisition of CBios and (ii), on the merits, the granting of security definitively, confirming the preliminary injunction. The Minister of Mines and Energy presented a response defending the absolute incompetence of the STJ, since the CNPE has merely propositional competence, aimed at advising the President of the Republic, and the contested act is effectively carried out by the President. He argued that there is no illegality, disproportionality or unreasonableness in relation to the 2020 annual target. He claims that there was no delay in disclosing the annual targets, he alleges that there are enough CBios on the market and time for their acquisition and that the plaintiff intends to claim an alleged right to pollute more, affronting public order, health and the economy. Furthermore, he stressed that there were enough CBios available on the market. He stated that the granting of the preliminary injunction interferes (i) with the fulfillment of international commitments to reduce carbon emissions of which Brazil is an integral part, as in the Paris Agreement, (ii) negatively in the population's quality of life, with a view to reducing the quality of the environment in which they live and (iii) in the economic model created for the implementation of Renovabio's instruments and in the Federal Government's own collection estimate. Finally, it requested the recognition of the STJ's absolute incompetence, as it is a writ of mandamus that seeks to challenge an act of the President of the Republic, as well as the non-granting of the injunction and the intended security. A monocratic decision was handed down that rejected the preliminary injunction, as the mandatory annual targets had been known since March 2020 and no illegality or disproportionality was seen in the disclosure of the target reduction. The Rapporteur Justice issued a monocratic decision denying the injunction, as he recognized the incompetence of the Superior Court of Justice to process and judge a writ of mandamus against an act of a collegiate body presided over by a Minister of State (Precedent 177 of the STJ) and the passive illegitimacy of the requested authority.",In progress,[],[],[],,https://climatecasechart.com/?post_type=non_us_case&p=17180
AGAPAN and others vs. IBAMA and others (Construction of the Nova Seival Thermoelectric Power Plant),"This is an action filed as a Precautionary Action (AC), by five civil society organizations, and later converted into a Public Civil Action (ACP). At first, the AC aimed at suspending the holding of a public hearing regarding (i) an open-pit coal mining project, (ii) construction of the Nova Seival Thermoelectric Power Plant (UTE), considered the largest in the State of Rio de Janeiro. Grande do Sul (RS) and (iii) construction of other works in the hydrographic basin. The requesting organizations stated that the convening of the public hearing was carried out in disagreement with current legislation and that violations of procedural rights can have serious legal and social consequences, including compliance with the Brazilian Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), assumed under the Agreement of Paris, and the forecasts of the National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009) and the Gaucho Policy on Climate Change  PGMC (State Law 13,594/2010), as well as they would have impacts on public health. They argued that the Environmental Impact Study and the Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) present an incomplete and incorrect analysis, mainly because they disregard the socio-environmental damage and risks to water security in the region. When dealing with community participation and access to information, the applicants discussed the pillars of environmental justice. They also stated that the construction of the UTE should be preceded by a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA). Finally, they asked for the suspension of the virtual public hearing and, in the sentence, for the publication of a new public notice. A decision was rendered rejecting the precautionary measure.Challenges were presented by Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. with Energia da Campanha Ltda., claiming passive illegitimacy in favor of the latter, which allegedly would own the enterprise, and IBAMA, all of whom claimed the absence of irregularities in the procedure.Subsequently, the applicants submitted a request to convert the AC into ACP with a preliminary injunction. They highlighted that Nova Seival is part of a complex network of projects that have environmental impacts and that must be analyzed together. In addition to procedural and transparency-related defects, they pointed out several omissions in the EIA/RIMA, such as the performance of modeling based only on past data, without presenting a projection for the operating period of UTE Nova Seival and without relating to the other thermoelectric plants of the region. They argued that no analysis was made of their synergistic and cumulative impacts on social apparatuses already weakened by the region's pollution, nor the impacts of the construction of the dam for agroecological production. Based on the precautionary principle and facing the climate emergency, they requested the inclusion by IBAMA in the Terms of Reference (TRs) that deal with UTE licensing processes in RS of the PNMC and PGMC guidelines, considering the need to carry out SEA in the undertakings with great polluting potential due to the burning of mineral coal, in addition to the inclusion of risk analysis to human health. A decision was rendered that accepted the request to convert the AC into ACP and, later, partially granted the preliminary injunction, especially with regard to (i) annulment of the virtual hearing held, (ii) suspension of the environmental licensing process and (iii) insertion of climate guidelines in the TRs of UTE in RS, considering the need for SEA for potential large polluters.Due to the preliminary decision, the companies Copelmi Mineracao e Energia da Campanha filed an Interlocutory Appeal (AI) 5040314-16.2021.4.04.0000, followed by IBAMA (AI 5041566-54.2021.4.04.0000). Within the scope of the companies' AI, a decision was rendered suspending the appealed decision regarding (i) annulment of the virtual public hearing held on 05/20/2021 and (ii) insertion of the climate guidelines in the TRs. The Federal Union filed a defense alleging passive illegitimacy and absence of cause of action or order related thereto.The companies Copelmi Mineracao and Energia da Campanha filed a new challenge alleging that there was no cause of action related to the request on the TRs and that this request would be illegal, since the energy planning already considers the contribution of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) from the sector for the NDC assumed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement, stating that UTE Nova Seival is in line with national energy planning; in addition to emphasizing the importance of maintaining fossil sources for energy security. He also stated that the SEA is intended to assess the environmental effects of a particular policy, plan or program and not of individual projects, and its requirement is not applicable in this case.IBAMA filed a defense alleging, among several issues, that the plaintiffs did not apply for an injunction to cancel the virtual public hearing held on 05/20/2021 and the inclusion of TRs in the licensing of the disputed enterprise and in all licenses of thermoelectric plants in Rio Grande do Sul. . It considers that there is no risk of damage that justifies the granting of the preliminary injunction, as the EIA/RIMA is still under analysis, with no granting of the license by IBAMA and the consequent authorization to start the works. It highlights the ineptitude of the initial regarding the claim to include the PNMC and PGMC guidelines, since (i) there is no cause of action on this claim and (ii) it is an illegal request, considering that it is about controlling legality in the abstract of a generic administrative act in an ACP with a specific object. Furthermore, on the merits, IBAMA refutes several arguments presented by the authors, such as the need to analyze the merits of the environmental licensing before the public hearing, based on CONAMA Resolution 237/1997. It also emphasizes that assessments on climate change are already addressed in the required TR, as the measures for compensation and mitigation of environmental impacts in licensing processes, whose projects emit GHG, are provided for in IBAMA Normative Instruction 12/2010. Regarding the AAE, IBAMA argues that it is not responsible for preparing such a study. It states that the creation of SEA with the objective of providing a more holistic view of environmental assessment in plans, programs and public policies does not remove the fact that it is not regulated at the federal level and, therefore, is not mandatory in the licensing process . It adds that the measurement of cumulative and synergistic impacts is not exclusive to AAE, being present in the EIA, as provided for in CONAMA Resolution 01/1986. It states, in conclusion, that, by introducing a requirement not provided for in federal legislation for all licensing of thermoelectric plants in Rio Grande do Sul, the court would be acting as a positive legislator, usurping the competence of CONAMA. Finally, it requires (i) the revocation of the preliminary injunction, (ii) the recognition of the ineptitude of the initial in relation to the request for inclusion in the TRs that deal with the licensing of the UTE in the state of the guidelines provided for in the PNMC and PNMG and (iii), on the merits, the dismissal of the requests. A decision was rendered, in the first instance, in which the Court rejected the preliminary arguments based on the understanding that: (i) the preliminary of passive illegitimacy of the Union is confused with the merits and will be decided as such; (ii) Federal Law 13,806/2019 amended the National Cooperative Policy (Federal Law Law 5,764/1971), giving cooperatives the possibility of acting as procedural substitutes for their members, and concluded for the active legitimacy of COONATERA  BIONATUR; (iii) with regard to the passive illegitimacy claimed by the defendant, he highlighted that he had already decided on the passive legitimacy of Copelmi at a previous moment, and understood that the preliminary argued about the fact did not discuss damages from the licensing that could generate liability for the company and that the licensing of the mine and the thermoelectric plant must be done separately if it is confused with the merit and will be decided as such. In addition, it granted the request for admission as amicus curiae made by the Brazilian Association of Members of the Public Ministry for the Environment (ABRAMPA), the Arayara International Institute of Education and Culture, and the Brazilian Association of Thermoelectric Generators (ABRAGET). Finally, it considered possible the early judgment of the dispute, since the case deals with a matter of law that demands exclusively documentary evidence, declaring the procedural instruction closed.

Rede Sustentabilidade vs. National Environment Council (ADPF 749 on CONAMA Resolutions),"On October 2, 20202, the political party Rede Sustentabilidade filed a constitutional claim (Allegation of Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF)) questioning CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, which revoked CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002. The revoked resolutions regulated the permitting of irrigation activities and the definitions of permanent preservation areas (APPs) - a protected area within private properties - in artificial reservoirs, mangroves and sandbanks. Furthermore, it questions the new CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, which changed the permitting of waste processing activities in rotary kilns, revoking the CONAMA Resolution 264/1999. The plaintiff argues that (i) the burning of pesticides, (ii) the APPs and (iii) the modification of the form of environmental permitting for irrigation and burning of toxic waste are against environmental protection efforts. 

The plaintiff claims that there is a violation of the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment, in view of the setback in norms that controlled activities with potential environmental degradation or potential increase in the waste of natural resources. No regulation aiming at the same ends of environmental protection was presented to replace the revoked norms, evidencing the socio-environmental setback with consequences that the authors claim will be felt by current and future generations regarding the water, climate and pollution agendas in a systemic way. When questioning the repeal of Resolution 303/2002, which deals with the protection of mangroves and sandbanks on the Brazilian coast as APPs, The plaintiff highlights its consequences for climate change. It argues that the restinga and mangrove areas contribute to carbon sequestration, being important for mitigating climate change, and helping reduce the vulnerability of the coastal zone, which are the areas most affected by these changes, demonstrating its importance for adaptation. The plaintiff emphasizes that the legal protection of these areas is necessary to enable, among other benefits, the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, it reinforces the importance of CONAMA Resolution 303/2002 due to the special protection granted to the Atlantic Forest, especially with regard to restingas. Finally, in the discussions regarding CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, the GHG emissions that occur in the waste burning process are also mentioned. 

The plaintiff request, as precautionary measures, the suspension of the effects of CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, with the return of validity of Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002; and the suspension of the new CONAMA Resolution 499/2020 on licensing the activity of co-processing waste in rotary kilns for the production of clinker, which revokes and replaces Resolution 264/1999. Definitively, the plaintiff request a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Resolutions. 

Justice Rosa Weber determined the joint processing of this ADPF with ADPFs 747 and 748, due to the similarity of objects. On November 11, 2020, a monocratic decision, later confirmed by the Plenary of the Federal Supreme Court, partially granted the preliminary requests to suspend the effects of CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, with the immediate restoration of the validity and effectiveness of the CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002. However, the request to suspend the effectiveness of CONAMA Resolution 499/2020 was rejected. 

A final decision confirmed the preliminary judgment and declared CONAMA Resolution 500/2020 unconstitutional, determining the immediate restoration of the validity and effectiveness of CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002, dealing with licensing of irrigation activity and on parameters, definitions and limits of APPs, as it was understood that the mere revocation of rules necessary to comply with environmental legislation, without replacing or updating them, compromises compliance with the Constitution, current legislation and international commitments. The judgment of the preliminary decision regarding CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, on the licensing of waste co-processing activity in rotary clinker kilns, was also confirmed, rejecting the request as to its unconstitutionality based on the understanding that the new normative parameters established would be compatible with the constitutional text.

Federal Public Ministry and INCRA vs. Dauro Parreira de Rezende (Deforestation and weather damage),"This is a Public Civil Action filed by the Federal Public Ministry (MPF) against Dauro Parreira de Rezende due to the deforestation of an area of 2,488.56 hectares, between 2011 and 2018, in Boca do Acre, Amazonas. The MPF alleges that the occupation of the land by the defendant would have occurred illegally because it was an area included in the Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE) and in a property of interest to the Federal Union, managed by the National Institute of Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractive communities. The argument of the action is based, among other points, on Brazilian environmental law, with regard to the constitutional protection of the environment, the accusation of deforestation, civil liability propter rem for environmental damages, including climatic damages, and collective moral damages. . It also mentions, as an environmental liability, the unauthorized emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) caused by illegal deforestation in the area, estimated at almost 1.5 million tons of carbon dioxide and which are directly related to the Brazilian State's removal from its climate goals, in disagreement with national and international commitments assumed by Brazil in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). Among other things, it is required (i) the repair of damages caused by illegal deforestation; (ii) the immediate interruption of activities that allow damage sequencing; (iii) payment of compensation, corresponding to intermediate and residual environmental material damages; (iv) payment of compensation corresponding to climatic damages; (v) payment of compensation, corresponding to the illegally earned profits from deforestation, from the exploitation of wood present in deforested areas, and (vi) payment of compensation, corresponding to collective pain and suffering. In an injunction, the Court confirmed the competence of the Federal Court as it was Federal Union land; confirmed the request for urgent relief and demanded that the defendant remove, within a period of 15 (fifteen) days, counting from the effective knowledge of the decision, all the bovine herd found in the areas; confirmed the fumus boni iuris and the periculum in mora and ordered the defendant to vacate the deforested area and cease the exploitation of extensive cattle ranching without legal authorization to do so. The court postponed the reversal of the burden of proof to the sanitation phase of the process. Finally, the injunction summons INCRA to express its interest in being part of the active pole of the dispute. The municipality has already presented a manifestation requesting its entry as an active co-joint. In response, the defendant alleges that the deforestation was caused by third parties, that the amounts requested are incorrect and that the climatic damage is inaccurate and based on IBAMA's Technical Note.

Arayara Association of Education and Culture vs. Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. and FEPAM (Guaiba Mine Project and hydrological risks),"This is a Public Civil Action (ACP), with a request for urgent provisional relief of a precautionary nature on an incidental basis, filed by the Arayara Association of Education and Culture against Copelmi Mineracao Ltda., FEPAM and the National Water Agency (ANA), claiming that the Guaiba Mine Project will cause harmful impacts to the inhabitants of the metropolitan region of Porto Alegre, as a result of hydrological risks. The project is the largest open pit coal mine in Brazil, with a high potential for water pollution. The plaintiff points out flaws in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project, neglecting to comply with important permitting phases, such as holding public hearings in affected communities. The plaintiff claims that the project poses a risk of pollution, especially to the Jacui River, which contributes with 86.3% of the average flow of Lake Guaiba, which is responsible for supplying drinking water to several municipalities. It highlights the need to analyze the extent of possible environmental damage resulting from the undertaking and the synergies with other infrastructures designed for the region. It also argues that the Guaiba Mine Project will impact the balance of water resources, which is inextricably linked to climate change, and thus mobilizes the National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). Therefore, actions such as pollution of springs, diversion of water courses, lowering of water tables, drainage of aquifers, among other harmful measures related to the Project, are directly or indirectly related to climate change. It is required, among other points, (i) as a preliminary injunction, the suspension of the permitting process for the Guaiba Mina Project until the judgment on the merits, so that the installation of the mine is prohibited and (ii), on the merits, the prohibition of the installation of the project in the originally planned location, in view of the irreversible environmental damages that it will cause to the region, in addition to the declaration of nullity of the environmental licensing procedure with the initiation of a new procedure that contemplates all the risks and the elaboration of an action plan for emergency, with a view to mitigating the consequences of possible environmental damage. 

After the defendants' preliminary statements, a decision was rendered recognizing the passive illegitimacy of ANA and, consequently, the incompetence of the Federal Court to judge the action. Thus, the action was redistributed in the Court of Justice of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (TJRS).

ADPF 814,"This is an Allegation of Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF), with a preliminary injunction, filed by ABRAMPA, related to Decree 10,143/2019 and MMA Ordinance 575/2020, which changed the composition of the Climate Fund Management Committee and its process deliberative. It is exposed that the institutional rearrangement promoted by the Federal Executive Power excluded the representativeness of states and municipalities, leading to a disproportionate increase in the Union's decision-making power. It emphasizes the exclusion of representatives of the scientific community, non-governmental organizations, urban and rural workers and traditional communities, having, on the contrary, increased the participation of business sectors. It is alleged that the normative acts discussed exceed the space of administrative discretion and violate the Environmental Constitutional State. It is argued that there is a deformation of the discussion forums and definition of climate policy. It also understands that the transparency of the deliberative process of the Management Committee has been reduced, given that the meetings can only be recorded by the Ministry of the Environment and accessed by the members of the collegiate. It also explains that, under the modified composition, the Management Committee of the Climate Fund approved inappropriate allocation of funds. Refers to the contribution of the entirety of non-reimbursable resources to the Lixao Zero Rondonia Project  in the total amount of R$ 6,207,228.00, without a previous technical feasibility study. It informs that only 4% of Brazilian Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions came from the solid waste sector, which confirms the inadequacy of the project selected for the purposes of the Climate Fund. Thus, it is required, in an injunction, that the effects of the contested rules be suspended and, definitively, the declaration of their unconstitutionality.

FossielVrij NL v. KLM,"On May 24, 2022, campaigners for Fossielvrij NL issued a letter of summons to Dutch aviation company KLM at a shareholder meeting of AirFrance-KLM. The letter states that KLM will be sued in violation of European consumer law if it does not cease misleading advertisement claims under its Fly Responsibly campaign to the effect that CO2 compensation measures and alternative fuels can make flying sustainable. The Fly Responsibly ads present the airline as creating a more sustainable future and on track to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050.

Environmental organisations FossielVrij NL, Reclame Fossielvrij en ClientEarth claim that there is no such thing as flying responsibly at present, and that KLM seeks company growth and increased flight sales, whilst it should be reducing emissions by reducing the number of flights to keep a just, liveable world within reach. Specifically, the organizations claim that customers are offered to buy carbon offset  labelled CO2ZERO  by funding reforestation projects or KLMs purchase of biofuels, but that such labels are misleading and that such products do not make a meaningful contribution to reducing KLMs footprint. Moreover, KLMs marketing undermines the urgent action needed to minimise climate catastrophe.

The case builds on a national decision of the national Advertisement Code Commission on 8 April 2022, the Dutch media watchdog dealing with complaints about misleading advertisement under the Advertisement Code. The commission ruled that elements of the Fly Responsibly campaign violated the codes provisions on misleading advertising, especially those elements referring to climate neutrality or CO2ZERO. This includes slogans like Be a hero, fly CO2ZERO or CO2 neutral: KLM compensates for the CO2 emissions of your KLM Holidays flight. The Commission noted, inter alia, that whilst the reforestation program in which KLM invests meets certain recognized theoretical standards (e.g. Gold Standard certification), there exist doubts in practice and amongst experts that emission reduction certificates purchased by KLM, result in the full and permanent compensation 'down to zero' of personal flight footprints in practice, as suggested by the campaign. The absolute environmental claims of CO2-neutrality and CO2ZERO must be accompanied by sound, independent, verifiable and generally recognized evidence that in practice there is also guaranteed full compensation.

In re Vaclav Havel Airport Expansion,"Three petitioners challenged the Principles of Territorial Development of the Central Bohemia Region (the tool for urban development of the region issued by the local self-governing authority), in relation to the approved expansion of an airport in Prague, specifically the definition of an area for a new parallel runway. On June 24, 2020, the Court granted the motion to annul the principles. The main reason for the annulment was the significant sources of noise and emissions (other than GHG).

In the supplementary submission from April 2020, the petitioners stated that the principles of territorial development also undermine the objectives of the Paris Agreement, as the expansion of the airport would create additional indirect GHG emissions. On June 24, 2020, the Prague Regional Court rejected this supplementary submission on procedural grounds (because extension to other points was not possible at this stage and the original petition mentioned only substances harmful to health such as benzo(a)pyrene) but decided to comment on it. 

On the Paris Agreement, the Court stated that the states commitment to a gradual reduction of GHG emissions could not be invoked in any activity related to air traffic. All the more so given that the contracting authority of the principles of territorial development is not the state itself, but a local self-governing authority that is not bound by any national law to fulfill the states obligation under an international treaty.

Jara Alarcon Luis /Environmental Assessment Service,"Plaintiffs challenged the environmental impact assessment for the continuation of a mining project in Cerro Colorado, in the Taparaca Region of Chile. The main claim refers to the lack of due consideration of citizen observations on the mining project's impact on groundwater resources and related surface ecosystems. 

The court did not question the methodology for evaluating the impact on water resources, nor did it annul the mitigation measures originally imposed within the evaluation process. Quite the opposite, it considered that these measures were aligned with the relevant norms. However, the Tribunal considered that a proper approach considering the country's international commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement also requires the incorporation of climate change scenarios. Thus, it requires re-assessing the mitigation measures regarding the extraction of groundwater water resources in the area in light of current and potential climate change impacts.",Decided,['Chile>Segundo Tribunal Ambiental'],['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting>Natural resource extraction'],"['UNFCCC>Paris Agreement', 'Chile>Law 19.300']",Relevant considerations in environmental impact assessment in the context of mining project under climate change regime,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/jara-alarcon-luis-environmental-assessment-service/
Communication to the OECDs Arrangement on efforts to expand the Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Sector,"On October 20, 2021, the UN Special Procedure on hazardous wastes, Mr. Orellana, and human rights and the environment, Mr. Boyd, issued a communication Participants to the OECDs Arrangement on Officially Supported Credit Arrangement on their efforts to expand the Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Sector Understanding (currently, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States). They note that mining and combustion of thermal coal make an outsized contribution to the aggravation and causation of the global climate crisis, with devasting effects on the effective enjoyment of rights to life, health, and a healthy environment. 

The communication notes that according to recent reports from the IPCC, UNEP, IEA, and UNICEF, the negative effects of coal mining and combustion, including on childrens rights, are overwhelmingly clear and worrying. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, all countries need to immediately stop construction of new coal power plants, phase them out completely by 2030 in advanced communities and close all of them by 2040 globally to meet the Paris temperature targets. Amongst the concerns cited are that coal-fired electricity causes about 35% of total methane emissions from all fossil fuel related sources, an extremely potent greenhouse gas (GHG). 

In follow up to G7 and other commitments, the Special procedures recommend that the Participants to the OECD Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Sector Understanding expand their commitment by agreeing to immediately (a) stop building new coal-fired power plants, (b) immediately terminate subsidies and export financing and guarantees for any and all actions related to coal-fired plants and exploration, extraction and production of thermal coal and associated infrastructure, without exceptions or exemptions;  (c) require existing coal-fired plants to be closed by 2030 in high-income nations and by 2040 in middle-income nations.

The group replied on December 17, 2021, that they agreed in a meeting on October 22, 2021, to end official export credit support and to tie aid support for unabated coal-fired power plants2. This ban came into force on 1 November 2021 and will be reflected in the next version of the groups Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, to be issued in early 2022. They also noted that recommendations on stopping construction of new plants, phasing out, and subsidies are not issues that might be addressed or resolved by the groups working on export credits at the OECD. There are, however, further plans to improve due diligence screening and assessments of project applications for potential severe project-related human rights impacts in further amendments of other instruments, and the human rights experts are welcomed as stakeholders in the consultation to provide advice on how responses to potential human rights impacts could be enhanced.",Pending,['United Nations>UN Special Procedures>United Nations Special Rapporteurs'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Youth/Children', 'Suits against governments>Trade and Investment>Climate-justified measures', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other']","['Netherlands>Universal Declaration of Human Rights', 'Netherlands>ICESCR', 'Netherlands>ICCPR']","Special Procedures ask Participants to the OECDs Arrangement on Officially Supported Credit Arrangement to commit to immediately stopping to build and support new coal-fired power plants, and require existing coal fired plants to terminate by 2030 in high-income nations, and 2040 in middle income nations.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/communication-to-the-oecds-arrangement-on-efforts-to-expand-the-coal-fired-electricity-generation-sector/

They contend, in particular, that the climate change that affects them is driven, to a large extent, by fossil energy industry and that the 1994 Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), ratified by all twelve Respondent States, protects investors in that sector from regulatory changes and gives them access to exorbitant remedies through investor-State dispute settlement mechanisms, thereby inhibiting the Respondent States from taking immediate measures against climate change and making it impossible for them to attain goals enshrined in Article 2 of the 2015 Paris Agreement.

Asmania et al. vs Holcim,"Four inhabitants of the Indonesian island of Pari have sued Swiss-based major buildings materials company Holcim (from 2015 to 2021: Lafarge Holcim). In July 2022, they filed a request for conciliation before the Justice of the Peace of the Canton of Zug, Switzerland. This is a necessary step required by the Swiss Civil Procedure Code.
The plaintiffs are supported by three NGOs: HEKS/EPER (Switzerland), the European Center for Constitutional and European Rights (ECCHR) and WALHI (Indonesia).
The plaintiffs request:
	proportional compensation for climate change-related damages on Pari
	reduction of CO2 emissions by 43 % by 2030 and by 69% by 2040, relative to 2019 levels
	financial contribution to adaptation measures on Pari
The claim can be seen as novel and unprecedented as it combines two approaches: reduction of GHGs and compensation.

On February 1, 2023, following a Conciliation Hearing before the Justice of the Peace in October 2022 where no settlement was reached, the NGOs supporting the plaintiffs announced that the plaintiffs had formally lodged a lawsuit against Holcim with the Cantolnal Court of Zug (Kantonsgericht Zug). 

The legal basis on which the plaintiffs rely is Article 28 of the Swiss Civil Code (infringement of personal rights) and Article 41 of the Code of Obligations (redress for unjust harm). As to Holcim's historical emissions, the plaintiffs rely on a Study by Richard Heede/Climate Accountability Institute.

The Friends of Nature Institute v. Gansu State Grid,"On June 6, 2017, the Friends of Nature Institute (FON) sued the State-owned enterprise, Gansu State Grid for its high abandonment rate of wind power in violation of Articles 2 and 14 of the Renewable Energy Law. Article 2 provides a definition of renewables, and Article 14 requires that the grid companies purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources and provide connection service. In this case, Gansu State Grid purchased the electricity generated by wind power and solar energy, but did not connect it to the grid. Defendant provided a strict interpretation of Article 14 that a grid company does not have a duty to put all the renewable electricity it purchases on the grid. Though under Article 29 of the same law, a grid company is responsible for failure to purchase all electricity produced from renewable sources only if such failure were to cause economic damage to the producer, FON argued for an extensive explanation of Article 29 that the defendants high curtailment of wind and photovoltaic power resulting in GHG emissions should have been prevented, and that the Gansu State Grid shall be held responsible for the environmental damage caused by its use of coal-fired power.

On August 14, 2018, the Lanzhou Intermediate Peoples Court rejected the NGOs claims on procedural grounds. The Court reasoned that the Gansu State Grid, because it is solely responsible for the acquisition and distribution of electricity, does not engage in activities that directly cause pollution or degradation. As a result, the applicant failed to meet the conditions for instituting an action. Unsatisfied by this decision, FON appealed to the High Court of Gansu Province. 

On December 28, 2018, the High Court of Gansu Province overruled the decision of the lower court. On the ground of Article 119 of the Civil Procedure Law, as there were specific defendant and claim, the High Court upheld the application on procedural issues and ordered the Gansu Mining Area Intermediate Court to hear the case. 

On June 5, 2019, the Gansu Mining Area Intermediate People's Court accepted the case and published the Courts notice to inform the parties. The case is now being heard on its merits by the court. Due to the travel restriction after the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in Gansu, the judges have held discussions with the parties but have not taken further action. 

On April 10, 2023, a mediation agreement was reached between Gansu State Grid and FON under the supervision of the Gansu Mining Area Intermediate Peoples Court. According to the agreement, Gansu State Grid agreed to (a) invest 1.98 billion CNY at first and then at least 913 million CNY to put the renewable electricity on the grid before 2025; (b) submit a report annually during the implementation of the above mentioned project to the Gansu Mining District Peoples Court, the copy of which shall also be transferred by the court to FON; and (c) disclose information related to the consumption of clean energy, subject to public supervision.",Settled,['China>High Court of Gansu Province (Gansu State Grid)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage']",['China>Renewable Energy Law'],Whether a company's failure to connect renewable energy to the grid is unlawful as it generates additional GHG emissions. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/the-friends-of-nature-institute-v-gansu-state-grid/

Centre for Oil Pollution Watch (COPW) Vs NNPC (2018) Supreme Court of Nigeria,"On May 13, 2005, the Centre for Oil Pollution Watch (COPW) commenced legal action against the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). The NNPC was established by an Act of Parliament and carries on business of prospecting, mining, producing, exploring and storing persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil such as crude oil. It has offices, oil installations, oil pipelines, oil rigs and so on in different parts of Nigeria The case was brought in the Federal High Court, Lagos Division, over an oil spillage in ACHA Community of Abia State of Nigeria. The oil spillage was allegedly caused by the defendants negligence resulting from its pipeline, which had corroded due to lack of maintenance, had ruptured, fractured and spewed its entire Contents of persistent hydrocarbon mineral oil into surrounding streams and river of lneh/Aku, resulting in contaminating two community streams that were the major sources of water supply to the community. The plaintiff alleged that although the defendant contained the spillage on the surface, it failed to clean up or reinstate the Ineh/Aku streams/river. Furthermore, the plaintiff averred that the respondent was negligent in both the causation and containment of the oil spillage; that the spillage had harmful effect on living resources, marine life, human health and other usage of the streams. 

The respondent challenged the plaintiffs standing to sue and sought an order striking the suit. On February 9, 2006, the trial court struck out the suit for lack of locus having not suffered any injury at all, let alone any injury above every other member of the Acha community resulting from the alleged oil spillage. On January 28, 20013, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal by reaffirming the trial courts ruling. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court on March 9, 2013. On July 20, 2018, the Supreme Court unanimously granted the appeal in favor of the appellant.

The Supreme Court of Nigeria (SCN) held:
1.	That the appellant NGO had the standing to sue the respondent, thereby liberalizing or broadening the rule of standing. The Supreme Court specifically highlighted that public spirited individuals and organizations can bring an action in courts against relevant public authorities and private entities to demand their compliance with relevant laws and to ensure the remediation, restoration and protection of the environment.
2.	The Supreme Court further clarified that Accordingly, every person, including NGOs, who bonafide seek the due performance of statutory functions or enforcement of statutory provisions or public laws, especially laws designed to protect human lives, public health and the environment, should be regarded as proper persons clothed with standing in law to request adjudication on such issues of public nuisance.
3.	The Supreme Court also acknowledged that recognizing public interest litigation will help address some other barriers to access to justice, as poor communities without the financial muscle to sue which usually and disproportionately bear the brunt of environmental and climate change problems, will have the benefit of public spirited persons and organizations fighting their cause.
4.	The Supreme Court noted particularly, for the first time, that: there is no gain saying in the fact that there is increasing concern about climate change, depletion of the ozone layer, waste management, flooding and global warming etc... Both nationally and internationally, countries and organizations are adopting stronger measures to protect and safeguard the environment for the benefits of the present and future ... it is on account of this, inter alia, that I am of the firm view that this court, being a court of policy should expand the locus standi of the Plaintiff/Appellant to sue  Per Akaahs, JSC. 
Further, the national resources of earth... must be protected and conserved for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning and management as appropriate  Per Eko, JSC.
5.	The Supreme Court also made significant strides in greening the Nigerian Constitution and confirming the existence and enforceability of environmental human rights in Nigeria, in a manner that increases the possibility of successful climate change litigation in the country, especially by allowing public interest litigation. First, the Supreme Court held that Section 20 of the Nigerian Constitution on duty to protect the environment by the State is justiciable when read together with, and in the context of, a provision like section 4(2) of the Constitution, on the power to make laws to give effect to section 20. Second, the Supreme Court explicitly recognized for the first time, that section 33 of the Constitution which guarantees the Right to Life, implicitly includes and constitutes a fundamental rights to a clean and healthy environment for all. Third, the Supreme Court explicitly affirmed the enforceability of the environmental right in Article 24 of the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights as domesticated in Nigeria by the African Charter Act, Cap. A9 LFN 2004.

6.	Finally, the Supreme Court decision in the above case aligns with the Constitutional Human Rights approach to Environmental and Climate Protection taken earlier by the Lower Court/Federal High Court in Jonah Gbemre vs Shell and others. It demonstrates a significant positive paradigm shift in the attitude of the Supreme Court to environmental and climate change related claims. It provides additional human rights and constitutional tools for potential climate litigation in Nigeria.",Decided,['Nigeria>Supreme Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting']","['Economic and Cultural Rights', 'African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights', 'Nigeria>Constitution of Federal Republic of Nigeria']",Whether an oil spill affected the human rights of communities. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/centre-for-oil-pollution-watch-copw-vs-nnpc-2018-supreme-court-of-nigeria/
Raja Zahoor Ahmed v. Capital Development Authority,"On October 5, 1995 the Capital Development Authority, which is responsible for planning decisions in Pakistan's capital city of Islamabad, rescinded a previous decision to allow a number of residential properties to be converted to commercial use. It determined that the original decision would have been incompatible with the Master Plan of Islamabad. After rescinding the decision to allow commercial use of the properties, the Board issued notices to a number of property owners regarding their unsanctioned use of residential properties for commercial use. These notices were challenged by the petitioners and on February 16, 2015 the Islamabad High Court dismissed the petitions. The case was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.

On May 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a judgment in the case confirming the consolidated judgment of the Islamabad High Court. The Court found that the Capital Development Authority had been correct to determine that the original authorization for the conversion of the properties had been unlawful as it was not aligned with the Master Plan of Islamabad, and any deviation from that plan would have required approval by the Federal Government. The Court then went on to provide an explanation of the importance of orderly urban planning in the context of climate change. In particular the Court noted that future changes to existing urban plans would need to take climate change into account: ""It is doubtful that our early town planners were driven by climate considerations. However, climate must, in the wake of climate change, form a basic determinant of urban planning and design. Climate-resilient development in cities of all sizes is crucial for improving the well-being of people and increasing the life opportunities of future generations. Any change in the Master Plan to an urban scheme without taking account of the climate factor would be detrimental.""

The Court went on to note that climate change can impact a number of fundamental constitutional rights, including the fundamental rights to life, dignity and property guaranteed under Articles 9, 14, 18 and 23 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The Court argued that including adaptation and sustainability considerations in urban planning is essential for the protection of these rights and ordered that Pakistan's urban planning authorities should take this into account in future, stating: ""The CDA shall ensure to factor in adaptation, climate resiliency and sustainability into their plans, policies and decisions in order to protect [...] constitutional rights.""",Decided,['Pakistan>Supreme Court'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],['Pakistan>Constitution'],How climate change considerations should be taken into account within urban planning decisions.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/raja-zahoor-ahmed-v-capital-development-authority/
Humane Being v. the United Kingdom,"On July 26, 2022, the NGO Humane Being filed an application to the European Court of Human Rights in the first case challenging factory farming in the UK. The application alleges that the UK Government is in breach of their obligations under Articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention for failing to address the risks of the climate crisis, future pandemics and antibiotic resistance created by factory farming. This application poses novel climate arguments focusing on the danger of agricultural methane emissions, and highlighting soy feed consumption in UK factory farming as a key driver of deforestation in the Amazon basin. The application also cites for the first time before the ECHR the ruling of the Brazilian Supreme Court in PSB  et al v Brazil (on Climate Fund), which recognized the Paris Agreement as a human rights treaty. Given the urgency of the case and other pending climate cases before the ECHR, an application has been made for the case to be assessed on a priority basis. 

In January 2023, the case was declared inadmissible pursuant to procedure which does not involve a public decision. The Court found that the applicants were not sufficiently affected by the alleged breach of the Convention or the Protocols thereto to claim to be the victims of a violation within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.

Plan B.Earth and Others v United Kingdom,"On July 11, 2022, Plan B. Earth, Adetola Onamade, Jerry Amokwandoh, Marina Tricks, and Tim Crosland filed an application at the European Court of Human Rights against the United Kingdom with a request under Rule 41 (priority). The claimants allege that, in breach of its legal obligations arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK Government is systematically failing to take practical and effective measures to address the threat from man-made climate breakdown. Articles 2, 8 and 14 of the Convention impose on governments the positive obligation to take reasonable and proportionate steps to safeguard the right to life and to family life and to do so without discrimination. That means: (i) aligning emissions reductions to the 1.5 C Paris objective; (ii) preparing for the impacts of climate change, so far as that is possible (including by providing the public with good information); (iii) aligning public and private finance flows to the 1.5 C Paris objective; and (iv) making the polluter pay, with effective mechanisms to ensure compensation and reparation for the victims of climate change.

Nevertheless, in March 2022, the UK Court of Appeal refused to hear the Claimants case on the basis that the Paris Agreement was irrelevant: The fundamental difficulty which the Claimants face is that there is no authority from the European Court of Human Rights on which they can rely, citing the Paris Agreement as being relevant to the interpretation of the ECHR, Articles 2 and 8 [the rights to life and to family life]. It also ruled that the fact that the family life of the three young people bringing the claim is inextricably linked to communities on the frontline of the crisis in the Global South was irrelevant to determining the scope of their right to family life, despite the prohibition against discrimination in safeguarding Convention rights.

In January 2023, the case was been declared inadmissible pursuant to procedure which does not involve a public decision. The Court found that the applicants were not sufficiently affected by the alleged breach of the Convention or the Protocols thereto to claim to be the victims of a violation within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention.

Czech Republic v Poland (Mine de Turow),"APPLICANT: Czech Republic
DEFENDANT: Republic of Poland
INTERVENER (in support of the applicant): European Commission

The case concerns the operation of the Turow lignite mine that supplies lignite to the 1984 megawatt Turow power plant, both owned by the Polish Energy Group (PGE). Emitting almost 10 million tons of carbon dioxide each year, the plant has been on the EUs list of power plants with the highest negative impact on climate for years. The axis of the dispute was the negative impact on groundwater in Czech Republic. In 1994, the mine obtained a concession to extract lignite until 2020. In 2015, it requested an extension of the concession for six years. According to the Polish legislation, the extension was possible without conducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA). In March 2020, the mine received the requested prolongation until 2026. 

On September 30, 2020, the Czech Republic took Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) (the General Court) under Article 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), arguing that Polands extension of the concession was unlawful because no EIA had been conducted, as required by EU Directive 2011/92. The applicant claimed that the Republic of Polands actions were unlawful by: (i) allowing the extension by 6 years of the development consent for the extraction of lignite without conducting an EIA, (ii) excluding the public from the procedure for granting the consent for extraction, (iii) declaring the EIA decision to be immediately enforceable, (iv) failing to allow the intervention of the public and of the Czech Republic in the procedure, (v) failing to enable judicial review of the mining development consent granted, (vi) failing to publish the mining development consent granted. As such, Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Directive 2011/92. 

In February 2021, the Czech Republic asked the CJEU for interim measures, requesting the immediate closure of activities of the lignite mine. The CJEU granted the interim measures by Order of the Vice-President of the Court of 21 May 2021. However, Poland did not comply with that order. On September 20, 2021, the CJEU ordered Poland to pay the European Commission a penalty of EUR 500,000 per day from the date of notification until that Member State complies with the order. On February 3, 2022, the Court of Justices Advocate General (AG) Prita Pikamae stated in his opinion that Poland had violated the EIA Directive. 

On February 4, 2022, the Czech Republic informed the CJEU that as a result of the settlement reached with Poland on the dispute, it waived all claims.

Complaint to the European Ombudsman on oil and gas imports from Russia,"Since the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine, the European Union has continued to import Russian oil and gas. EU imports constituted 61 percent of Russias fossil fuel exports (besides oil and gas also coal) in the first one hundred days of the war. Oil and gas exports are an important part of the Russian economy, the revenues of which make up 45% of Russias 2021 budget, according to the International Energy Agency. The imports of Russian oil and gas are governed by Regulation 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 on common rules for imports. Article 1 of that Regulation states that such oil and gas shall be freely imported into the Union and shall not be subject to any quantitative restrictions. To decrease dependence on Russian oil and gas, the European Union has adopted REPowerEU, a plan to rapidly reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition. The plan focuses on saving energy, diversifying energy supplies, accelerating the rollout of renewables, and smart investments. The plan has no specific timeframe to achieve its goals but aims to achieve the reduction ""as soon as possible"" and ""well before 2030,"" 2030 being the target set before the adoption of the plan. 

On May 25, 2022, Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), Avaaz, Notre Affairs a Tous, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, and Svitlana Romanko, co-founder of the Stand With Ukraine campaign, filed a complaint with the European Ombudsman, Emily OReilly, alleging that the EU failed to conduct an impact assessment before continuing its imports from Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The complainants contend that the EU is obliged to assess the impact of its oil and gas imports on both human rights and GHG emissions. The complaint states that the EU oil and gas imports are a critical source for Russia to finance its war efforts, thus contributing to the human rights violations it says are happening in Ukraine. At the same time, the complaint states that the Commission has not adequately assessed the implications for climate change of its current and planned measures to reduce Russian oil and gas imports. The complaint mentions that the Commissions plan to find alternatives for Russian fossil fuels risks locking in fossil fuel use.

The content of the assessments is described in detail in a letter sent on April 26, 2022, and attached to the complaint. In that letter, the complaining parties ask the Commission to:
-	assess the full range of measures that are both available to the EU  including a full cessation of imports of Russian oil and gas  appropriate to ensure that the EU does not contribute to the ability of Russia to prosecute its war of aggression in Ukraine;
-	examine  and consider other authoritative studies which examine  all available means of rapidly reducing reliance on Russian oil and gas within the EU;
-	assess the implications for the EUs greenhouse gas emissions of any measures it considers to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas;
-	assess how a rapid reduction in the EUs reliance on Russian oil and gas can be achieved in a manner that is most consistent with the imperative of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

The complaint states that the EU is obliged to respect international law in the exercise of its powers and that conducting an impact assessment is part of that obligation. In not conducting such an assessment, the EU has not acted in accordance with the principles of good administrative behavior. The complaint specifically mentions that the EU has violated art. 6 (proportionality) and 9 (objectivity) of the European Code of Good Administrative Behavior. 

After receiving the complaint, it is up to the Ombudsmans office to determine whether the complaint warrants an inquiry. If the Ombudsman opens an inquiry, she can find that (1) there is no maladministration, (2) make a proposal to the institution to resolve the matter, or (3) find that there is maladministration and make recommendations to address the maladministration. The Commission then has three months to respond.

Wayuu Indigenous community and others v. Ministry of Environment and others,"On February 22, 2019, the Wayuu Indigenous community of Northern Colombia and other individuals filed a lawsuit seeking the annulment of the environmental license (among other resolutions) that authorized the Cerrejon Zona Norte Coal Mining Project in La Guajira region since 1983. Plaintiffs claim that the environmental licensing process failed to comply with environmental provisions and principles, violating the rights of the Wayuu community and the general population to a healthy environment, human health, and free, prior and informed consent. Among petitioners requests is a study of all water bodies that are being affected by the mine operations including the costs in terms of ecosystem preservation and the health of the vulnerable communities. 

Particularly, plaintiffs argue that every natural resource exploitation project should consider the specificities and realities of climate change. Petitioners also claim that environmental licensing processes must analyze Colombias obligations to address climate change and Sustainable Development Goals  SDGs before issuing a permit. Among the plaintiffs arguments is that the Colombian government failed to consider the impact of coal mining on climate change when studying the environmental permits request. Plaintiffs invoked the correlation between coal mining and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to ask for the mines closure as a way to ensure the transition towards a cleaner energy and Colombias compliance with its international commitments.

Finally, along with the main lawsuit, plaintiffs also asked for a precautionary measure that prevents the environmental authorities from issuing modification permits in this particular project. Petitioners argue that any expansion of the existing mining project could worsen the environmental harms and climate change effects.",Pending,['Colombia>Council of State>Administrative Tribunals'],"['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Other', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting']","['Colombia>Law 99 of 1993', 'Colombia>Constitution']","Whether the environmental license of Cerrejon Zona Norte Coal Mining Project violates environmental provisions and human rights to FPIC, health and a healthy environment due to its effects on climate change and GHG emissions.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/wayuu-indigenous-community-and-others-v-ministry-of-environment-and-others/
Dennis Murphy Tipakalippa v National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority &amp; Anor,"The applicant, Munupi Senior Lawman and Tiwi Traditional Owner Dennis Tipakalippa, is from the Tiwi islands, a biodiversity haven approximately 80 kilometres north of the Australian city of Darwin. The applicant sued the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), the Australian Governments offshore energy regulator, and an oil and gas company, Santos Limited, over the approval of plans to drill the Barossa gas field in waters off Northern Australia. The applicant claimed that NOPSEMA did not have jurisdiction because the requisite consultations with the applicant were carried out. 

Proceedings regarding an application for an interlocutory injunction restraining Santos from commencing or continuing offshore drilling until the expedited final hearing, which was scheduled for six weeks after the proceedings for interlocutory relief, commenced on July 13, 2022. After accepting that the applicant had demonstrated a prima facie case, the injunction was denied on the basis that drilling will not have gotten underway to a significant extent by the time the hearing came about and of earlier representations made by the applicant indicating he was prepared to accept harm occasioned by the drilling of one well over a short period in order to be availed of the opportunity to stop the vast majority of the approved drilling at an expedited hearing.

In a decision issued on September 21, 2022, the Federal Court of Australia found that NOPSEMA was not lawfully satisfied that consultation had occurred. An order was made to set aside the decision approving Santos Limiteds drilling plans. Work has been paused on the project and Santos Limited will be unable to continue the project without the approval.

Australian Conservation Foundation Incorporated v Woodside Energy Ltd &amp; Anor,"Scarborough is a proposed new gas project off the north-west coast of Western Australia that would cause an estimated 1.37 billion tonnes of greenhouse pollution over the next 25 years. Although the gas would be extracted off the coast of WA and much of it burned overseas, it would affect the Great Barrier Reef in Queensland by fuelling climate change, which is causing repeated coral bleaching events on the reef. Scarborough has never been approved under Australias federal environment protection law - the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act) -  because offshore gas and oil projects are assessed in a streamlined process by the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA) and exempt from the EPBC Acts operation. However, that exemption does not apply if an offshore project is likely to have a significant impact on the World or National Heritage values of the Great Barrier Reef. The applicant, the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) believes the greenhouse gas emissions that will result from the Scarborough project are likely to have a significant impact on the Great Barrier Reef.

ADI 7095 (Complexo Termeletrico Jorge Lacerda),"On March 10, 2022, the political parties Rede Sustentabilidade (Rede), Partido Socialismo e Liberdade (PSOL) e Partido Socialista Brasileiro (PSB) filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI), with a request for a precautionary measure, against the Brazilian Congress. The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educacao e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. The case questions the constitutionality of articles 1 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022, which establishes an economic subsidy to small-scale public service concessionaires and creates the Just Energy Transition Program (TEJ). The applicants claim that the articles extend the contracting of electricity generated by the Jorge Lacerda Thermoelectric Complex (CTJL) with subsidies from consumers for another 15 years from 2025, which includes the purchase of energy from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the CTJL is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the southern region of Brazil, the applicants allege that there is a violation of the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017), as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). They emphasize that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, exacerbation of climate change and damage to public health, especially in relation to populations that are already subject to socioeconomic disadvantages. They argue that the TEJ makes it possible to extend the operation of the CTJL until at least 2040. Further, the norm has not presented guidelines for the reduction of GHG by the Complex. On the contrary, the TEJ stated that there will be no abatement of carbon dioxide. Finally, the applicants argue that the composition established for the TEJ Council violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is no equalization of the number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors related to environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines. As a precautionary measure, the plaintiffs request that the Law is interpreted according to the Constitution, so that they are considered unconstitutional. Further, that the the subsidy established by the Law is suspended and declared unconstitutional, suspending the effects of articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Law. The plaintiffs request, as a final measure, that the Court (i) gives an interpretation in accordance with the Constitution to articles 1, 2 and 3, considering them unconstitutional and prohibited the granting of the subsidy under the terms of the Law and (ii) that articles 4 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022 be declared unconstitutional.",Pending,['Brazil>Federal Supreme Court'],['Suits against governments>Just transition'],"['Brazil>PNMC (Federal Law 12 187/2009)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 5', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 1']","Whether the Just Energy Transition Program, which provides subsidies to a coal generating complex, is unconstitutional.

Challenging criteria and technical requirements to perform fracking in Colombia,"On August 23, 2016, a Colombian citizen filed a lawsuit to challenge the validity of Decree 3004 of 2013 and Resolution No. 90341 of 2014 issued by the national government and the Ministry of Mines and Energy. These norms establish the criteria and requirements to perform fracking in Colombia. The petitioner argued that the challenged norms allowed fracking in Colombia, despite the significant number of scientific studies that substantiate frackings adverse and irreversible effects on human health and environmental stability. 

On July 7, 2022, the Council of State decided against the plaintiffs claims. The court found that there was no violation of the Constitution or Law 99 of 1993 and declared the challenged norms valid. The court considered that fracking was already authorized by other existing and valid norms and that the challenged acts were merely contributing to its regulation. The court reasoned that all fracking-related norms should be interpreted holistically and comprehensively, preventing the court from declaring, as argued by the plaintiff, that the challenge acts were insufficient or inadequate. The court decided that the challenged acts complemented the criteria and requirement to perform fracking. The court restricted the legal analysis to the possible contradiction of superior norms that could undermine the validity of the acts. However, the court concluded that this contradiction was not proved during trial.

The court explicitly invoked the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, among other norms, and stated that the precautionary principle is crucial for the protection of the climate system in benefit of future and present generations. Moreover, the decision mentions that according to the expert witnesses and reports, fracking, and fossil fuel exploitation in general prevent Colombia from reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change. Nevertheless, the court considered the challenged acts did not violate this principle. According to the court, the precautionary principle does not mean zero risk scenarios, rather controlled scenarios to reach environmental and economic development goals. In the courts opinion, the challenged acts are part of a broader set of norms that regulate fracking in Colombia in a way that does not contradict any superior norm.

Smith v. Attorney-General,"In March 2022, the plaintiff, a Maori landowner and tribal climate spokesperson, argued that the successive New Zealand governments had failed to adequately address the effects of climate change on New Zealand and its citizens, especially Maori. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that the government had failed to incorporate international obligations into domestic law, and to reduce the carbon emissions produced by government activities. Furthermore, although the government had introduced an emissions trading scheme, the plaintiff argued that the overall emissions cap was set too high and contained unjustifiable exemptions. 

The plaintiff advanced three causes of action. First, plaintiff argued that the government owed (and had breached) a common law duty of care owed to New Zealanders, to take all necessary steps to reduce NZ emissions and to actively protect the plaintiff and his descendants from the adverse effects of climate change. Secondly, plaintiff alleged that the New Zealand government had breached the rights guaranteed under sections 8 and 20 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA), namely the rights to life and the rights of minorities. Finally, the plaintiff alleged that the New Zealand government had failed to act in accordance with its obligations under te Tiriti o Waitangi | the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti), New Zealands founding document. The defendant applied for the claims to be struck out.

In July 2022, the Court struck out all three claims as untenable. First, it found that the common law duty of care lacked reference to any recognized legal obligations, and went beyond mere incremental development of new obligations. Furthermore, it was beyond the democratic role and institutional competence of a Court to monitor the full scope of the governments climate change response. Next, the Court found that the right to life claim was untenable because the plaintiff had not pointed to a real and identifiable risk to a specified individual. Furthermore, the minority rights claim had failed to particularize specific breaches, NZBORA s 20 does not impose positive duties on the State, and that the Crown had taken adequate steps to consider the interests of Maori. Finally, the Court found that Te Tiriti does not give rise to free-standing obligations, and that plaintiffs claim was too wide-ranging to give rise to fiduciary Te Tiriti obligations because such obligations would untenably be owed to the public in general. Even if such duties were to be developed, they would need to rely on the common law duty advanced in the first cause of action, which the Court deemed untenable in any event.",Decided,['New Zealand>High Court of New Zealand'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Indigenous Groups']","['New Zealand>Bill of Rights Act 1990', 'New Zealand>Common law', 'New Zealand>Treaty of Waitangi']","Whether New Zealands climate law framework violated common law duties, statutory rights, or te Tiriti o Waitangi | the Treaty of Waitangi.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/smith-v-attorney-general/
ClientEarth and others v. Flemish Region,"In 2021, Flemish authorities announced their approval of petrochemicals giant INEOS plastics plant project ('Project One') in the Port of Antwerp, Belgium. 

ClientEarth and 13 other NGOs argue that this project would have tremendous and inadequately assessed environmental impacts, namely in the form of plastic pollution and climate change exacerbation. As a consequence of these concerns, these NGOs submitted an appeal against the permit to the Flemish Ministry of the Environment in early 2022. They argued, in particular, that the permits Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) failed to meet the legal requirements and should not be granted. 

This appeal was dismissed in June 2022. A month later, the NGOs announced that they would bring the Flemish authorities to court to challenge this decision to dismiss their appeal. They argue that ""INEOS has so far failed to present an adequate assessment of how the project would impact the climate, nature and surrounding air quality  all of which are likely to suffer significantly if the project goes ahead,"" and that ""the Flemish authorities approved the project without first fully assessing its impacts  making the approval illegal according to EU and national laws."" 

In July 2023, the Council of Permit Disputes (""Raad Voor Vergunningsbetwistingen"") ruled in a parallel case brought by Dutch authorities in Belgium that INEOS failed to tell Flemish authorities the full extent of its project's predicted impact on the environment, so much so that these authorities should not have granted the project's approval.

"Fliegenschnee et al. v. Federal Ministry for Digitalisation and Business Location, Austria","On 12 August 2021, three natural persons, an Austrian municipality, and the NGO Global 2000 applied to the Minister for Digitalization and Business Location. They demanded issuing an ordinance that establishes a gradual ban on the sale of fossil fuels in Austria. The sale of solid fossil fuels should be banned from 1 January 2025, the sale of fossil heating oil from 1 January 2030, the sale of fossil fuels from 1 January 2035, and the sale of fossil fuels for aviation from 1 January 2040. In support of their claim, the applicants argued that they were directly affected by the climate crisis, which mainly results from burning fossil fuels - a practice that needs to be halted to protect life, health, and the environment. 
One of the applicants asserted that climate change-induced heat waves posed a significant health risk due to pre-existing conditions; another applicant brought forward that she would severely suffer from the impacts of climate change due to her young age. The applicant municipality, in turn, stated that due to its location in the Alpine region, it was exposed to a significant risk of landslides during heavy rainfall events, which endangered the lives and health of its citizens. The fourth applicant, a farmer, argued that climate change-induced drought and resulting crop failures endangered her livelihood and caused ecological harm. 

The applicants relied on EU Secondary Law, fundamental rights, and the Austrian Trade Regulation Act to support their claim:
The Minister should rely on Art 69 of the Austrian Trade Regulations Act to issue the demanded sales ban. The latter provision authorizes the Minister to determine measures tradespeople shall take regarding the goods they produce or sell to avoid risks to health and life or environmental pollution. According to the applicants, the Minister could, for example, prohibit operators of petrol stations from selling fossil fuels by relying on Art 69 Trade Regulations Act. 
The applicants further argued that their right to request the above-mentioned sales ban grounds in EU Secondary Law and fundamental rights. The EUs Effort Sharing Regulation (2018/842) sets binding GHG reduction targets for its Member States - according to the applicants, it aims at protecting the life and health of European citizens and thus confers subjective rights to them. European citizens may thus demand their member state to comply with EU reduction targets and adopt respective measures. The applicants supported their claim by relying on earlier case law regarding air pollution control in which the European Court of Justice recognized a subjective right to require issuing an ordinance in case of exceedance of limit values. (See Janacek v. Bayern, ECLI:EU:C:2008:447, ClientEarth v. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, ECLI:EU:C:2013:805). 
In addition, the applicants derived their right to demand the issuance of an ordinance from fundamental rights, in particular Art 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which oblige the state to take measures against climate change. 

In the first instance, the Federal Minister dismissed the application for lack of competence. In her decision, the Minister argued that the requested measure, namely a transition from fossil to clean energy, was not covered by its constitutional competences, and that she was thus not authorized to issue the requested ordinance. According to the Minister, Art 69 of the Austrian Trade Regulation Act only concerns the prevention of threats specific to the trade and industry sector. It cannot be invoked for higher-level objectives such as the transition to green energy. 

In the second instance, the administrative court of Vienna addressed whether the plaintiffs could demand the enactment of an ordinance on the phasing out of fossil fuels. The court held that the Effort Sharing Regulation is directed at EU Member States and that subjective rights could principally arise from the regulatory content of the regulation. However, the regulations wording does not show the European legislators intent to grant EU citizens subjective rights. Therefore, the applicants are not entitled to demand compliance with the Effort Sharing Regulation or the enactment of the proposed ordinance. 
Regarding fundamental rights, the court held that legislative and administrative inaction could not be challenged and that it was not competent to order an administrative authority to issue an ordinance. Furthermore, positive obligations arising from fundamental rights only apply to localized natural disasters and hazards. The applicants could not demand the enactment of an ordinance for phasing out fossil fuels based on fundamental rights. 

In the last instance, the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint. The court did not find a violation of the applicants right to their lawful judge as a decision on the merits was rightfully denied by lower instances: The administrative court of Vienna had rightly concluded that a subjective right to demand the issuing of ordinances could not be derived from the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Further, fundamental rights do not require granting a right to demand the issuing of ordinance based on Art 69 Trade Regulations Act. Fundamental rights, particularly Art 2 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, give rise to positive obligations in case of severe environmental threats. The state enjoys a wide margin of discretion in fulfilling its positive obligations; a violation only occurs if suitable measures are missing entirely or if the measures adopted are not suitable to achieve the objective pursued. 
Fundamental rights do not entail the applicants right to demand the issuing of an ordinance. Hence, their claim was dismissed.

ClientEarth and Ecologistas en Accion v. Spain,"On October 6th 2021, Client Earth and Ecologistas en Accion filed a complaint to the European Commission over pollution in the Mar Menor Lagoon, located in the Region of Murcia, as a result of the increased socio-economic use of the area with a convergent increase of activities that include agriculture, tourism, fishing, or old mining operations. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that contrary to the obligations envisaged in the Nitrates Directive and relevant national nature laws, Spain has taken superficial steps to protect Mar Menor Lagoon from harmful agricultural practices and failed to take necessary measures to avoid deterioration of the lagoons ecosystem and protected animal species. The plaintiffs request the European Commission to launch infringement proceedings against Spain, in accordance with art. 258 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union.

In December 2021, the European Commission referred Spain to the Court of Justice of the European Union for poor implementation of the Nitrates Directive.

"Spain v. Apostolos Mangouras &amp; Others (""Prestige"" case)","In 2002, the oil tanker Prestige sank off the coast of Spain, causing significant environmental damage in the northern coast of Spain and the southern cost of France. This accident led to a lengthy criminal investigation against the master of the vessel. The criminal claims were accompanied by civil liability claims, which were brought by several legal persons, including the Spanish State, against the master and owners of the Prestige and the London P&I Club, the insurer of the ship and its owners. These civil liability claims were grouped and resolved by the criminal court in a single procedure. The Supreme Court applied the rules applicable to environmental accidents regulated in the international conventions CLC92 and IOPC Funds and stated that the defendants were liable and should pay an amount of compensation for damages, depending on their level of responsibility in the environmental disaster. 

In its ruling of 2016, the Supreme Court determined the bases for assessing the damages, including consequential damages, loss of profits and moral damages caused ""not only by the feeling of fear, anger and frustration that affected a large part of Spanish and French citizens,"" but also by ""the indelible imprint of the perception that catastrophes of this or greater magnitude can affect the same injured parties at any time."" The determination of the indemnities was subsequently established by the provincial court of La Coruna, by order of the Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court applied both an objective and subjective test to establish liability for damages. By the objective test, the court ruled that the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) must pay part of the damages up to the economic ceiling it had to bear in accordance with its own rules. For the remaining damages to be compensated, the court applied the fault-based liability test, condemning the ship's master for gross negligence, on the basis of he acted ""with intent to cause such damage or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably be caused."" It also convicted the shipowner for ""extraneous acts"" as two requirements were met: (1) that there is a relationship of dependence between the perpetrator and the principal, whether a natural or legal person, for whom he works; and (2) that the perpetrator acts within the scope of his duties, albeit in excess of his duties"". The court also found that the shipowner acted with conscious and deliberate disregard of the serious environmental risks involved in its actions, and therefore capable of invalidating the shipowner's right of limitation under the CLC92 by its own terms. Finally, the insurer had to assume the amount of civil liability it was entitled to under the insurance contract.

By order of 15 November 2017, the Audiencia Provincial de La Coruna (Regional Court of La Coruna, Spain) set out the amounts that each of the claimants was entitled to obtain from the respective defendants. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld in part and rejected in part the appeal filed by the defendants in 2018 in relation to the amount of compensation referred to in the ruling of the Provincial

Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) v. Mexico (on the Climate Change Fund),"The General Law on Climate Change in Mexico was issued in 2012. This law contemplated the Climate Change Fund, a public trust fund created to increase the existing resources to address climate change. According to article 80 of the Law, it had the objective of attracting and channeling public, private, national, and international financial resources to support the implementation of actions to address climate change. However, in 2020 the Mexican Congress reformed the Law and eliminated the Climate Change Fund. 
 
On December 17, 2020, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) filed a complaint against the amendments, arguing among others, that it violates the constitutional right to a healthy environment. The plaintiff requested an injunction to suspend the effects of the amendments, asking the Court to stop the elimination of the Fund. The injunction was denied.
 
 However, the Judge considered that the reform did not restrict the exercise of any right. The Judge argued that the reform did not disappear the funds to address climate change, it only reallocated the resources on to the Federal Expenditure Budget. Therefore, the Court decided the case against CEMDA, considering it did not violate the right to a healthy environment. CEMDA appealed the decision before a Collegiate Tribunal. 

In August 2021, the Tribunal decided, due to the relevance of the case, to send the appeal the Mexican Supreme Court. The Supreme Courts decision is still pending.

On April 12, 2023, the Supreme Court decided that it is not up to the judges to evaluate whether a public policy, in a broad sense, is suitable to fulfill a specific purpose, since these decisions correspond to the executive and legislative branches of government. Considering that the modification of the strategy to combat climate change (to extinguish the Climate Change Fund and transfer that budget directly assigned to the Environmental Secretariat) is a matter of public policy, this modification cannot be analyzed by judges. Legislators have ample freedom to determine the mechanisms they deem appropriate to direct the policy to combat climate change. 

Furthermore, it was determined that it was not demonstrated that the Funds resources, after the modification, will not be used in a correct, transparent and equitable manner.

Therefore, the Judges decision was confirmed, and the claim was denied.",decided,"['Mexico>District Court in Administrative Matters', 'Mexico>Supreme Court']",['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment'],"['Mexico>General Law on Climate Change', 'Mexico>Constitution']",Whether the elimination of the Climate Change Fund violates the constitutional right to a healthy environment.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/mexican-center-for-environmental-law-cemda-v-mexico-on-the-climate-change-fund/
Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) v. Germany,"On September 5, 2022, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) filed a lawsuit against the German government in the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. 

The case challenges the Sofortprogramm (immediate action program) presented by the Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport.  8 of the Federal Climate Change Act (KSG) requires federal government ministries to draft immediate action programs where the emissions in their respective sectors have exceeded the permissible annual emissions budget. These plans are to demonstrate compliance with the annual sectoral emission budgets for the following years. Any immediate action program is to be presented to the Council of Experts on Climate Change which is tasked with assessing and examining the assumptions on greenhouse gas reduction that underlie the measures. ( 12(2) KSG). 

In its consideration of the Transport Ministrys immediate action program, the Council of Experts found that the measures suggested in the immediate action program were not sufficient to comply with  8 (1) KSG. It calculated the cumulative emissions gap to amount to 261 million tons CO2-equivalent by 2030. On the basis of these findings and its own calculations, DUH is arguing for the short-term enforcement of an immediate action programme that complies with the (CO2) requirements of the Federal Climate Change Act. 

In its submission to the court, DUH outlines several measures and their calculated emissions reductions that could, they submit, be included in an immediate climate action program:
1) 100/80/30 speed limits on highways/outside of cities/in cities
2) Reduction of climate damaging subsidies for, amongst others, diesel and company cars
3) Introduction of a CO2-based new registration tax
4) Nationwide 365 ticket and rapid expansion of local public transport and rail 
5) Mileage-based passenger car toll
6) Moratorium on new construction and expansion of federal road network 
7) Adaptation of the Road Traffic Act and Road Traffic Regulations to reflect climate and environmental considerations

Lauwrys A.O. v. The Province of Antwerp,"On April 3, 2019, GABRIELS & CO l.c. requested an environmental permit to build and exploit a new gas station in Boechout, a municipality of Belgium located in the Flemish province of Antwerp. The process for obtaining such a permit includes a public inquiry, during which 51 objections to the project were raised. The municipal authority refused to deliver the permit to the requesting company on the basis of the fact that the envisaged gas station was not future proof in that it did not include a recharge point for electric cars nor did it provide for compressed natural gas. 

In the meantime, the local authorities of Boechout adopted a 2020 charter to become a climate neutral municipality, following which they established a climate action program. According to this program, enterprises with an establishment in Boechout need to contribute toward this goal; the project of GABRIELS & CO, on the contrary, violates the action program.

GABRIELS & CO l.c. started a procedure in appeal again the refusal decision. Once more, the local authorities rendered a negative decision, confirming their standpoint. Similarly, the provincial environment officer gave a negative advice for the project. However, the provincial government, on appeal, eventually decided that the project should receive an environmental permit on the ground that the reason used by the local authorities to refuse to deliver the permit is illegal.

After the permit was delivered, prospective neighbors of the envisioned gas station sought to suspend and annul the environmental permit before the Council for Permit Disputes, a special administrative tribunal under Belgian law.

In the course of the suspension procedure, the Council found that Art. 4.3.4 of the Flemish Code for Spatial Planning is an optional ground for refusal for projects that are not compatible with the objectives and duties of care of the local authority concerned. The Council decided that the environmental permit was not carefully motivated because there was no research on whether the project would be compatible with the environmental objectives of the community of Boechout or whether mitigating measures would be sufficient to compensate the negative advice of the community of Boechout. On this ground, the Council suspended the decision of the provincial government on April 22, 2021. 

In the primary procedure, which sought to annul the permit, the Council found on December 9, 2021, that there was insufficient justification with regard to the gas stations compatibility with the residential area in which it was to be built and with its immediate surroundings; such compatibility is an important component of good spatial planning, and, as such, suffices as a ground to refuse to deliver an environmental permit. (As is common practice in Belgian law, the Council only discussed this plea, which is in itself was sufficient to annul the decision to deliver the permit, and ignored the other arguments of the plaintiffs.)

This case is indicative of the growing tendency under (Flemish) Belgian environmental law to assess environmental permit requests in light of climate objectives such as climate neutrality. Such assessment is mandated on the part of local authorities in the context of their general duty to practice good spatial planning.

Ecodefense &amp; Other NGOs v. Russia,"On September 11, 2022, activists from several climate groups in Russia filed a case before the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation demanding that the Russian government protect its citizens from the risk of future death or serious illness by keeping global emissions to 1.5-1.8c  in accordance with its obligations under domestic and international law. The plaintiffs request Russian authorities to take measures that will reduce the countrys greenhouse emissions, in line with targets of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5C agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Russia is currently the fourth biggest producer of carbon emissions worldwide, and need to reduce 31% of its 1991 levels to meet the 2030 goal of the Paris Accords. The plaintiffs contends that Russias insufficient measures on climate change are violating the Russian constitution and the European convention on human rights. Russia will withdraw from the ECHR on Friday 16 September, which means the climate lawsuit could be among the last cases in the country that the ECHR could issue a binding agreement on, if it is taken to the European courts.

World Wildlife Fund Canada et al. v. Minister of Natural Resources et al.,"On July 26, 2022, the World Wildlife Fund Canada and The David Suzuki Foundation, supported by Ecojustice Canada, have filed in the Federal Court of Appeal an application for judicial review of the federal governments decision to extend 20 oil and gas sleeper permits originally granted off the coast of British Columbia in the late 1960s and 1970s. The applicants submit that these permits, held by Chevron Canada Limited and Exxon Mobil for offshore oil and gas exploration in British Columbia, were to expire decades ago, but Natural Resources Canada has indefinitely extended these permits in violation of the Canada Petroleum Resources Act.  As such, the applicants submit that because the federal government has unlawfully kept these permits on the books for more than 40 years, these permits should be found to be expired and invalid. The areas covered by the permits include Scott Islands Protected Marine Area and the Hecate Strait/Queen Charlotte Sound Glass Sponge Reefs Marine Protected Area in British Columbia. The applicants note that these sleeper permits pose an underlying threat to at-risk species and critical habitat in these areas, which are areas rich in biodiversity.

PCWP and others v. Glencore,"A legal complaint was lodged on behalf of The Plains Clan of the Wonnarua People (PCWP) and Lock the Gate Alliance, with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) and Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) regarding Glencores misleading claims about climate impact and its behaviour towards Traditional Owners.

Glencore operates 17 coal mines in Australia, making it Australias largest coal producer and biggest contributor to emissions from coal mining. 

Glencore publicly claims to have decarbonisation plans in place, however a legal investigation by the Environmental Defenders Office (EDO) found no evidence to support these claims.

Glencore is in fact expanding its coal production, and its net zero claims may amount to harmful greenwashing under the Corporations Act 2001 or Australian consumer law.

Lawyers from the London-based organisation ClientEarth have backed the action, writing to the UKs Financial Conduct Authority over the role of Glencore plc and urging them to coordinate with ASIC in a robust response.

Indonesian Youths and others v. Indonesia,"On July 14th 2022, 14 applicants filed a complaint against the Indonesian government to the Indonesian National Human Rights Commission. The complainants are youth and affected groups from various generations and regions in Indonesia who are affected by climate change. The complainants claimed that climate change has caused the complainants to face life-threatening hazards, reduced physical and mental well-being, increased health risks, food and water insecurity, along with disruption to their education and livelihoods. The complainants stated that they had experienced various impacts caused by climate change including 1) heat waves that caused death and heat-related illness and decreased productivity of outdoor works; 2) sea level rise which causes coral reef bleaching and declining fish stocks, causing food and job insecurity in tourism and fisheries; 3) an increase in extreme heat and rainfall brings disease, water and food insecurity; 4) the occurrence of tidal flooding, high waves, and strong winds due to sea level rise endangering lives and causing loss of shelter and vulnerability to food and water; and 5) complainants' aggravated mental health.

The complainants claim that the Indonesian government has violated their human rights guaranteed by the Indonesian constitution, by not taking the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures to prevent temperature rises above 1.5 degrees. The claim came from the fact that: 1) Indonesia is still heavily dependent on deforestation and fossil fuels, especially coal for economic growth; 2) Indonesia has inadequate emission reduction targets; 3) Indonesia still allocates significant available resources to support carbon-intensive industries; 4) Indonesia does not integrate adaptation planning into domestic policies and budgeting 5) Indonesia fails to ensure that social protection mechanisms work to reduce vulnerability to disasters and climate-related stresses; and 6) Indonesia does not prioritize nature-based adaptation. The complaint alleges that Indonesia governments insufficient action on climate change has violated the following rights under Indonesia constitution: 1) the right to life and the right to a good and healthy environment, 2) the right to develop oneself through the fulfillment of basic needs, 3) the right to food and water, 4) the right to education, 5) the right to work and earn a decent living, and 6) children's rights.",Pending,['Indonesia>National Human Rights Commission'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Youth/Children'],"['Indonesia>Constitution 1945', 'Indonesia>Human Rights Law 1999']","Whether the Indonesian government has violated its human rights obligations to Indonesian children and other vulnerable groups, by contributing to climate change and failing to take action to minimize climate risks.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/indonesian-youths-and-others-v-indonesia/
Idheas Litigio Estrategico v Centro Nacional de Control de Energia (CENACE) and Secretaria de Energia (SENER),"In August 12, 2021, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) and Green Peace, challenged a series of regulations that involved the setting of tariffs for renewable energy projects under legacy contracts. By an order of the District Court, the suit was divided in multiple trials due to the number and scope of the different regulations that were challenged.  Among them, the plaintiffs challenged the Agreement and its Annex to guarantee the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity, and security of the National Electric System in light of the SARS-CoV2 (COVID 19) pandemic, emitted by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE). The Agreement argued that that the intermittency of renewable energy projects jeopardized the reliability of the National Electric System. As such, it ordered CENACE to limit the operation of intermittent energy projects and to suspend and reject pre-operational trials of intermittent wind and photovoltaic power plants in the process of commercial operation.

The plaintiffs considered that the Agreement violated the right to a healthy environment, enshrined in the Mexican Constitution, since it prevented the participation of renewable energy projects in the electric market which would lead to an increase in greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change. Plaintiffs also argued that the Agreement prevents achieving an energy transition, as well as Mexicos international commitments to address climate change since it imposes restrictions on renewable energy projects.  

On April 19, 2021, the Second District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that CENACE did not have the authority to emit the Agreement and that it transgressed the individual and collective dimensions of the right to a healthy environment enshrined in the Constitution and several international treaties. On one hand, more greenhouse gas emissions would have an impact on human health. On the other hand, the court considered that the Agreement would prevent Mexico from fulfilling its commitments under the Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change since it limited privileged electricity generated by fossil fuels over renewable energy projects. Thus, even if there was no certainty of the degree of the risk or harm that the Agreement would cause, a proper application of the precautionary principle demands that the regulation is struck down.  The Court also emphasized that in these cases, there is a reversal of the burden of proof, which forced authorities to prove that the Agreement would not cause any environmental damage. Finally, the court considered that the Agreement was contrary to the progressive nature of environmental protection envisaged by the Mexican legal system, which limited the possibility of unjustifiably reducing or modifying any already achieved level of protection. This was the case since the 2015 the Energy Transition Act orders authorities to set goals so that electricity consumption is increasingly satisfied by economically viable clean energy sources. The Act orders a minimum of 25% of the demand for electricity satisfied by clean energy sources by 2018; 30% by 2021, and 35% by 2024. 

The authorities appealed the decision but the First Circuit Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications dismissed the appeal.

CEMDA v. Rise of Legacy Transmission Rates,"The Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) challenged the Mexican Electricity Commissions resolution increasing legacy transmission rates that affect renewable energy projects. Legacy energy projects refer to those energy projects that are regulated by the legal regime that existed prior to Mexicos 2014 energy reform. Under such regimes, energy projects receive special transmission rates, among other features. In the challenged resolution, the Mexican Electricity Commission increased the transmission rates that such projects must pay by between 500% and 800%, according to CEMDA.

Plaintiff considered that the new transmission rates transgress Mexicos international commitments on environmental and energy matters. They also highlighted that the increase in the rates is unjustified, disproportionate and will hamper Mexicos transition to clean energy sources. Finally, they considered that the obstruction of clean energy sources through the increased rates constitutes a violation of the right to a healthy environment since it will lead to an increased dependence on fossil fuels. 

The First District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications granted a stay of the implementation of the price increase in October 2020 pending the final decision of the trial. In the decision to stay the new rates, the District Court considered that the new transmission rates could signify an increase in greenhouse gas emissions that jeopardize human health, thus potentially infringing in the right to a healthy environment. 

In December 2021, the Third District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting, and Telecommunications was created by the Federal Judiciary Council, and the case was reassigned to it under the number 232/2021. 

On May 15, 2023 the Judge decided that the plaintiff, as an NGO, did not have legal standing to file the lawsuit because the plaintiff did not offer evidence that would allow to affirm that the challenged acts affect the environment. Furthermore, the Court considered that even though the civil organization has, as its purpose, the legal defense of the right to a healthy environment, this is not enough to prove its legal standing. Therefore, the case was dismissed.

Greenpeace v. Ministry of Energy and Others (on the Energy Sector Program 2020 and Electric Industry Law),"Greenpeace challenged the constitutionality of the amendments to the Electric Industry Act and the National Electricity Sector Development Program 2020-2034 (PRODESEN). In its suit, Greenpeace also asked for a stay of the implementation of both regulations. Plaintiff argued that the regulations displace the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation in favor of polluting, fossil fuel sources. This transgresses Mexicos international commitments on climate change. 

The First District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications granted a stay of the implementation of both the Act and PRODESEN. The court agreed with the plaintiffs in considering that the regulation could potentially transgress the right to a healthy environment by stalling the energy transition. 

The stay was appealed by the authorities. On September 1, 2022, the First Circuit Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications overturned the district courts decision, denying the stay. The court argued that the potential harms that could derive from the challenged regulations were conditioned by the need to modify and amend other regulations. In this sense, the harm was not sufficiently immediate to grant the stay. 

On January 9, 2023, the District Court ruled on the merits in favor of Greenpeace. The District Court decided that the 2021 amendments to the Electric Industry Law, as well as the Energy Sector Program 2020, violate the right to a healthy environment by prioritizing the energy generated through fossil fuels. On February 9, 2023, the Mexican government appealed the District Court decision to uphold the plaintiffs claims. The appeal is pending resolution by the appellate Collegiate Court.

The petitioners allege violation of several rights under the Constitution of the Republic of  Kenya 2010. Consequently, they seek to enforce climate change duties of public officials under  the Climate Change Act No. 11 of 2016 Laws of Kenya and other related constitutional rights  under the Constitution of the Republic of Kenya 2010. The Petitioners assert that they are  victims of climate change related flooding which has caused massive displacement and loss of  life and property. 
The petitioners contend that the flooding has been caused by hydro-meteorological variables  due to climate change. The ELC in Iten allowed an application by the Petitioners requesting the Chief justice and the President of the Supreme Court of Kenya to empanel a three judge  ELC bench to hear their case on the failure, neglect and or refusal by several government  officials to discharge their obligations under the Climate Change Act 2016. 

The petitioners seek 12 substantive orders among them, a declaration that relevant government  officials failed, refused and or neglected to take precautionary measures to anticipate, prevent  or minimize the causes of climate change and mitigate its adverse impacts; a declaration that  relevant government officials failed, refused and or neglected to avert, minimize and address  effects of climate change suffered by petitioners; an order to compel relevant government  officials to rehabilitate, relocate, and restore damaged infrastructure; an order for compensation  for climate change damage; and an order for resettlement of flood victims.

Decrochons Macron,"On February 21, 2019, actions of unhooking presidential portraits were launched simultaneously in Paris, Lyon, and the Basque Country (France). On this day, the activists of ANV-COP21 seized 4 official portraits of President Macron to denounce the climate inaction under his presidency. Brandishing banners that read ""Climate, social justice: where is Macron?,"" the activists then launched a call to multiply the campaign throughout the country. Arrests of climate protesters began the following day. On August 25, 2019, the ""March of the portraits"" for the climate brought together more than 900 people in Bayonne despite the ban on demonstrations during the G7. In the center of Bayonne, official portraits of President Macron sought by police forces resurfaced with the head facing down. A press conference drew up a severe assessment of the Macron government's climate policy and denounced the huge gap between his international speeches on climate and concrete actions in France. Nearly 100 journalists, including many foreign media experts, covered the march and the press conference given by several personalities and climate specialists.

Since the first demonstration, activists have taken 151 Macrons official portraits off city halls around the country, resulting in 86 searches and 1467 cumulative hours in police custody for 128 activists. 88 people were summoned in 56 trials, facing up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to 75,000 euros. Most of the demonstrators were discharged on the merits in the name of the state of necessity and freedom of expression. For example, in September 2019, two activists prosecuted for the robbery of a portrait of Emmanuel Macron obtained an acquittal from the Lyon High Court, in the name of the state of necessity. The judgment recognized the insufficiency of public policies to address the climate crisis and the legitimacy of portrait removal actions in a broken democracy. In September 2020, three new acquittals were granted by courts in Auch, Strasbourg, and Valence courts, where judges held that condemning the activists would be an attack on freedom of expression. In Valence, the court added that the state of necessity is established by the existence of imminent danger and the absence of disproportion between the means employed and the seriousness of the threat, therefore deciding that unhooking Macrons portraits to denounce his climate inaction is an act of general interest. The prosecutor's office systematically appealed the acquittals.

On September 22, 2021, the Court of Cassation rejected the state of necessity, but overturned the conviction of eight activists in Bordeaux, holding that unhooking presidential portraits can be a form of expression and that courts must justify that a conviction would not be a disproportionate infringement on freedom of expression. The court also recognized that DNA sampling of some activists was excessive for this type of non-violent action.

Guyane Nature Environnement and France Nature Environnement v. France,"The company EDF Production Electrique Insulaire intended to replace an old thermal power plant in French Guiana, Frances overseas region, which, due to its obsolescence and future compliance with regulatory standards, had to be shut down by December 31, 2023. A decree dated March 30, 2017, set forth the replacement of the thermal power plant by a new thermal power plant; the operation of this power by EDF was authorised by an order of the territorial authority on June 13th, 2017. By two orders dated October 22, 2020, the Prefect of French Guiana issued an environmental authorization for a new oil-fired thermal power plant construction project to proceed and a building licence. 

On July 7th, 2021, two environmental organizations (Guyane Nature Environnement and France Nature Environnement) requested the suspension of the environmental authorization to the interim relief judge (juge des referes) of the administrative court of French Guyana. On July 27th, 2021 and September 7th, 2021, the judge of the administrative court granted the request and suspended the authorization considering that there were serious doubts about the legality of the authorization. The suspension was based on: (i) the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions defined by law (-40% between 1990 and 2030), and (ii) the provisions of the urban planning code relating to the limited extension of urban development in areas close to the shoreline.

On August 11th, 2021, the Minister of Ecological Transition and EDF Production Electrique Insulaire asked the Council of State to overturn the suspension of work of the future power plant. On February 10th, 2022, the Council of State granted these requests and overturned the suspension of the Larivot power plant environmental authorization decided by the interim relief judge of the administrative court of French Guyana. The Council of State considered that there was no legal requirement to take into account the national energy policy objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030, as set out in article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code, for authorizations that do not relate to the operating of a power plant producing electricity using fossil fuels. 

The decision is based on the distinction between the conditions of issuance of an environmental authorization and the conditions of issuance of an authorization to operate the plant. The environmental organizations have contested the environmental authorization on the ground of breach of article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code. However, environmental authorizations must comply with the objectives of reducing GHG emissions as set forth in article L. 100-4 only in specific cases, and this was not one of them since it did not entail the authorization to operate the plant (which had been previously granted). 

With regards to article L.121-40 of the French Urbanization Code and the limited extension of urban development near coastlines, the Council of State held that the provision only applies to decisions authorizing urban developments. Therefore, the provision is not applicable to environmental authorizations, the purpose of which is not to authorize the construction of one or more facilities, but rather to authorize the future operation of such facility. The Council of State applied the principle of independence of legislation.

On April 28th, the administrative court of Cayenne has annulled the environmental authorization, stating that, even though the project of construction of a power station has to be considered as of major public interest, it is not proved that the two zones of the site known as the future park at Remire-Montjoly do not constitute satisfactory alternatives to the Larivot site for the location of the EDF-PEI power plant, making it possible to limit the damage caused to protected species. Therefore, it ensues that considering that there was no satisfactory solution other than the one chosen by the petitioner for the siting of the power plant at the Larivot site, the prefect incorrectly applied the provisions of 4 of Art. L. 411-2 of the environmental code.

EDF and the Ministry appealed this decision and the Administrative Court of Appeal of Bordeaux, on June 2022 suspended the decision of the annulment of the environmental authorization granted to EDF.

Moreover, on July 18th, 2022 the administrative court of Guyana issued the final decisions, which focus on the building license, and annulled such license, affirming that it does not respect the provisions of the urban planning code. More precisely, the administrative court affirmed that the Larivot site constitutes a characteristic site of the natural heritage of Guyana's coastline, sheltering an environment necessary for maintaining biological balance. As a result, the court considered that, given that the site chosen to host the power plant constitutes a characteristic site of the natural heritage of Guyana's coastline, the authorization failed to comply with the provisions of the town planning code. Moreover, the court affirmed that the environmental impact study carried out by EDF the French electricity company was vitiated by substantial shortcomings in the comparison of the environmental impacts of the various alternative sites envisaged by the project owner for the location of the power plant.

As a result of these two irregularities, the administrative court annulled the building permit issued to EDF-PEI for the construction of a power plant on the Larivot site. The administrative court rejected the other requests of the claimants, asking for the cancellation of the prefectural orders concerning the construction of a fuel transport pipeline over 14 kilometers between the port of Degrad-des-Cannes and the power station of Larivot.

EDF-Pei and the Ministry of Ecological Transition have appealed also this decision, claiming for a suspension of the enforcement of the judgment.

Regional Court of Konstanz's decision on climate neutral claims regarding heating oil,"The Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition sued a fossil and oil dealer in relation to an advertising on climate neutral premium heating oil, arguing that it posed a misleading commercial practice, and additionally, that it was misleading by omission.

The Regional Court of Constance denied that the claim was misleading pursuant to  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition because the plaintiff had not sufficiently substantiated the misleading nature of the claim. However, the Court upheld the action on the grounds of a violation of 5a para. 2 because the plaintiff had omitted essential information.

The Regional Court held that the plaintiff omitted essential information by not connecting the statements in the advertising with information on how the advertised climate neutrality of the heating oil was achieved. It reiterated the strict standard applicable to environment-related advertising claims. The court emphasised that it was essential for the defendant's customers to know if climate neutrality was achieved through energy reductions in their own operations, the partial use of renewable energies or the acquisition of certificates. The Regional Court highlighted that reductions would be considered as more important than the mere acquisition of certificates due to the companys significantly higher efforts and increased sustainability. In order to make an informed business decision, the customer needed information on how climate neutrality was achieved. The Regional Court also assumed that customers would be willing to pay more if climate neutrality was achieved by reducing emissions instead of merely offsetting them. In this case, however, the customers did not receive this information immediately, but only when they asked for it on the telephone. This was not sufficient, because the information would have been necessary when the business decision was made.",Pending,['Germany>Konstanz'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']",['Germany>The Act against Unfair Competition'],Whether the advertising claim climate neutral premium heating oil is a misleading commercial practice and/or misleading by omission ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/centre-for-protection-against-unfair-competition-v-anonymous-party-konstanz/
Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main's decision on climate neutral claims regarding detergents,"On December 2018, an anonymous party filed a suit against an anonymous defendant who had advertised their detergents as CO2 neutral on the packaging, flyers and on the internet. The advertising targeted professional traders. 

On November 2019, the Regional Court of Frankfurt stated that such a professional audience understood the advertising in the sense that the defendant produced the detergents (including the packaging) as possible CO2-free. This concerned the whole life cycle from raw material extraction, the transport of the raw materials, the production of the detergents to the packaging, delivery, and disposal. Insofar as these processes could not occur completely without emitting CO2, the emissions could be compensated through CO2 certificates. The Court found the advertising misleading and in violation of  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition because the defendant had not included the disposal of the detergents when calculating the CO2 emissions even though the advertising suggested that. The Court dismissed the defendants objection that they had considered the emissions due to disposal with a safety surcharge, because this did not meet the strict requirements regarding environment-related advertising claims.

Regional Court of Kleve's decision on company's climate neutral claims regarding sweets,"On December 2021, an anonymous party filed a suit against an anonymous corporation for misleading advertisement. 

The defendant, a company selling sweets, advertised that it produced all products in a climate neutral way. The relevant advertisement contained the statement: Since 2021, [...] has been producing all products in a climate neutral way. It was undisputed between the parties that the manufacturing process of the products was not CO2-neutral, but that the defendant supported climate protection projects. 

The plaintiff argued that the statement was misleading as it would be understood by the target consumer as meaning that the manufacturing process itself was climate neutral. At the very least, the advertising statement had to be supplemented to the effect that climate neutrality was achieved through compensatory measures. The defendant, on the other hand, argued that the complaint was unfounded, as it had taken several measures to reduce its emissions. It argued that because sweets could not be produced without emitting any CO2, the company supported climate protection projects, and thus, the CO2 released was offset in the balance sheet. The defendant further argued that the target public understood climate neutrality as balance-sheet climate-neutrality.

On June 2022, the Court found the advertising not to be a misleading commercial practice pursuant to the Act against Unfair Competition. The target audience of the advertising was a professional audience, because the advertising appeared in a food newspaper which addressed decision-makers in trade and the consumer good industry as well as industry-relevant service providers. The Court stressed that climate neutral was not synonymous with emission-free and that the former could also be reached through compensation. The targeted professional audience knew that climate neutrality could be reached through compensation. Therefore, the URL contained in the advertising under which information on the compensation could be find, sufficed. In contrast to consumers, it is common and reasonable for professionals to obtain information about a production from the information available on the internet.

Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main's decision on various climate neutral claims,"Both parties distributed cleaning products to professional customers nationwide. The defendant had been certified by an external company as a climate neutral company. The defendant used this certificate in their advertising, such as climate neutral company and climate neutral hygiene. 

Furthermore, the defendant had created and used a Youtube advertising video with such advertising claims. This video contained a URL with the website of the defendant with an explanation. The explanation contained comments about avoiding and compensating their emissions, using the ISO 14067 standard. It also included another URL where more information could be found. 

Next to the video, the defendant had also included an advertising on climate neutrality on their website. The website included another URL where initial information on the topic could be found. The plaintiff argued that these advertisings were misleading. 

The Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main found the advertising claims in the video to be misleading by omission and in breach of 5a para. 1 as neither the video nor the referenced website included necessary background information. The Court elaborated that the claim climate-neutrality required a great deal of explanation. Without the appropriate background information, the claim of climate-neutrality remained opaque for the target market, whether consumers or professional buyers. The Regional Court stressed the importance of the manner that climate-neutrality was achieved, as only in this context could buyers assess how high the companys efforts were to reduce or compensate their CO2 emissions. Ultimately, the claim climate neutrality depended on the standard applied. According to these standards, it was only possible for buyers to assess whether a company was really concerned with its own reduction of CO2 emissions or whether it was merely greenwashing if the company communicated the essential circumstances of climate-neutrality in clear and comprehensible manner.

The Court set out the specific disclosure requirements:

Assessment basis (Reference object: company or product);
Standard of calculation;
Excluded emissions;
Scope of own CO2 reduction measures and their savings effect, in particular in relation to CO2 emissions prior to implementation of the reduction measures;
Type of compensation;
Type and subject of the supported and / or self-implemented climate project and its CO2 reduction effects.

Furthermore, the Regional Court found the advertising on CLIMATE NEUTRAL COMPANY certified by Fokus on the website of the defendant to be a misleading commercial practice and in breach of  5 para. 1 of the German Act against Unfair Competition. This claim was misleading because it had been advertised without further information and because it was unclear on which basis the certification of climate neutrality had occurred. Even though another website had been referred to in the advertisement, necessary information was lacking there too. A further reference on that website did not suffice as nested information remained unclear. Instead, the Regional Court held that the information should be presented in a compact manner on a single website, using transparent and clear language.

Regional Court of Monchengladbach's decision on company's climate neutral claims regarding jams,"On December 2020, an anonymous party filed against an anonymous corporation for misleading advertisement. This case concerned an advertising on jams which included the statements climate neutral product and climate neutral value-for-money-classic. While it was undisputed between the parties that the production process of the jams itself was not CO2 neutral, but that the defendant financially supported reforestation projects in South America, the plaintiff nevertheless considered the advertising statement as misleading. They argued that the target consumer group would understand the statement insofar as the production process itself was climate neutral and that the same applied to the readership of the newspaper where the advertisement was published. 

On February 2022, the Regional Court of Monchengladbach held that an average end consumer would not understand the defendants claims to mean that the CO2 produced during the manufacturing process was offset by subsequent measures and that climate neutrality was achieved in balance. While it could be assumed that a normally informed consumer knew of the concept of climate neutrality through compensation, the average consumer would relate the statement to the specific product and the manufacturing process and not to offsetting. This was especially the case because in the situation of selling jam jars, the focus was on quick messages and quick decisions. The same applied to the advertising in the newspaper. Thus, the Court found the advertising statements to be misleading pursuant to  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition.

Regional Court of Oldenburg's decision on climate neutral claims regarding meat products,"This case was filed on December 2020. The advertised claims at issue concerned distributed meat products as well as the defendants operations which were advertised as climate neutral in an online newspaper. The Regional Court of Oldenburg held that the advertising on climate neutral meat products and climate neutral operations were misleading by omission pursuant to 5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition.

On December 2021, Regional Court reiterated the strict standard applicable to environment-related advertising claims and concluded that the advertising did not fulfil these requirements. According to the Regional Court, the consumers understood climate neutral in relation to the meat products either in the sense that CO2 emissions during the production or distribution were offset through climate projects or that CO2 had not been emitted (for instance, by using renewable energies or CO2 filters), or had been emitted in an insignificant manner. Thus, the Regional Court stated that there did not exist a clear consumer understanding of the statement climate neutral. 

The Regional Court further held that the advertising would have needed to include a clarifying statement that climate neutrality was understood in the sense of compensation and that climate neutrality was achieved through financial support of climate protection projects. While the defendant had listed a URL on the advertising site where the reader could learn more about the manner of achieving climate-neutrality, the claim climate neutral had been made in the advertising without any mention of compensation, and thus, the consumer had not been able to make an informed business decision.

Higher Regional Court of Schleswig's decision on company's climate neutral claims regarding bin liners,"The plaintiff contests the distribution of bin liners in a package with a label climate neutral as well as the indication that the product supports Gold Standard certified climate protection projects in order to achieve the UN climate goals. 

On July 2021, the Regional Court of Kiel found the advertising claim to be misleading pursuant to  5 para. 1 and 5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition. It stated that the average consumer understood the claim climate neutral in relation to all of the defendants products. But because the defendant produced non-climate neutral products as well, this was inaccurate. Furthermore, the Regional Court stressed that climate neutrality could be achieved through various means. In order for the consumer to make an informed decision, it was essential that they received information on the manner through which climate neutrally was achieved in an unproblematic way. 

The Regional Court did not find the indication on the support of Gold Standard certified climate protection projects as sufficient in this regard. The Regional Court found the indication of a website or a QR code on the packaging which included the relevant information to be necessary. This was not the case, as the information on the climate protection projects could only be found on further sub-websites. The Regional Court thus found that this did not meet the disclosure requirements, and moreover, that it suggested that the whole company was climate neutral even though this was not the case.

However, on June 2022, the Higher Regional Court of Schleswig overturned this judgment. It did not find the design of the packaging to be misleading pursuant to  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. Furthermore, it did not find the missing information on the packaging as to how climate neutrality was achieved as misleading by omission pursuant to  5a of the Act against Unfair Competition, because it held that the means of achieving climate-neutrality was not essential information.

More specifically, the Higher Regional Court held that the claim climate neutral did not suggest that the company exclusively produced climate neutral products. Furthermore, it stated that climate neutrality was an unambiguous statement and that it meant that the products advertised with it had a balanced carbon footprint. Lastly, it held that the claim climate neutral did not mean that the balanced balance was achieved completely by avoiding emissions during the production. This applied all the more if the claim was combined with a clearly visible indication that climate protection projects were supported in order to achieve climate neutrality. It stated that explanatory notes on the type and scope of the compensation measures were not required. Thus, it did not find that the advertising claim climate neutral for a product was misleading per se. This was all the truer if at the same time it was pointed out that climate neutrality was achieved through compensation measures.

Verbraucherzentrale Baden-Wurttemberg e.V. v. Commerz Real Fund Management S.a.r.l.,"On December 2022, the plaintiff filed a claim with the Regional Court of Stuttgart and argued that the advertising statements were misleading after the defendant themselves had massively relativised in other places. The defendant responded that the value was an investment target and could therefore be exceeded as well as fallen short of. With regard to the various quantities, an amount that was too low had been stated by mistake. An imputed misleading was therefore not relevant in any case.

Commerz Real Fund Management S.a.r.l. advertised a financial product, klimaVest, on a website. This fund invested in renewable energies projects and could therefore track concrete amounts of green electricity and avoided CO2 emissions. Furthermore, klimaVest was an Impact Fonds according to European Regulations and was obliged to pursue a positive ecological goal. This resulted in the klimaVest target (set value) of at least 3.5 tonnes of CO2 avoidance per EUR 10,100 invested per year. Thus, investors were able to indirectly support the avoidance of future emissions with their investment. On the website, internet users could calculate their personal CO2 footprint. This value was then compared with the desired CO2 offset through the investment. In a separate document, information was included that the investment objectives of the fund could not be guaranteed and that they could vary considerably over time. Under the FAQ category it was set out that the impact goal of klimaVest was to achieve a CO2 offset of at least 3.0 tonnes per year for every 10,000 euros of invested capital. The calculation basis for that was the CO2 calculator.

On January 2022, the Regional Court found the advertised claims to be misleading commercial practices and in violation of  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. It held that the claim of an absolute CO2 reduction of 3.5t or of a CO2 compensation of -3.5t was a statement suitable to mislead the target public, since they understood these statements as set values, which in any case would not be fallen short of, although these were in fact target values which could be significantly undercut. Furthermore, the Court found the differing statements on the targeted CO2 avoidance of 3.5t on one site and 3.5t on another site to be misleading by omission pursuant to 5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition.",Pending,['Germany>Stuttgart>Regional Court of Stuttgart (Landgericht Stuttgart)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']",['Germany>The Act against Unfair Competition'],"Whether advertising on an investment with its positive effect on the personal carbon footprint is a misleading commercial practice and/or misleading by omission, when it is done in such a manner that the consumer calculates the CO2 compensation dependent on the investment, indicating specific results

Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main's decision on company's climate neutral claims regarding frozen croquettes,"On December 2015, the Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition filed a claim in the Regional Court of Frankfurt a.M. against a company for its advertising on the packaging of frozen croquettes on the basis of  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition, arguing that it was misleading. The advertising claims were 100 % climate neutral and the worlds first 100 % climate-neutral potato specialist. From the potato field to the retailers freezer shelf. On their website, the defendant clarified the statement as follows: Being a climate-neutral company means that we try to avoid and reduce CO2-emissions. We offset the rest of our emissions by promoting projects that support renewable energy, energy efficiency and many other CO2-related issues.

On May 2016, the Regional Court confirmed the misleading nature of the claim and found a breach of  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition, referring to the strict standard for environment-related advertising claims. It stated that not only had the defendant used the buzzword climate neutrality but they had also made further statements which left the consumers with the impression that the production and distribution occurred entirely without CO2-emissions. However, this was inaccurate, as CO2 had been emitted in the process. The Court considered it irrelevant that the emissions had been compensated and that this was disclosed on the companys website, as the consumer did not have this information at the time of the purchase decision. 

This judgment was appealed. The oral proceedings took place before the Higher Regional Court Frankfurt in 2017 and the defendant ultimately withdrew their appeal.

Regional Court of Dusseldorf's decision on climate neutral claims regarding candles,"On December 2012, a candle-manufacturer was sued by a competitor due to their advertisement in a newspaper, containing the following wording: Climate neutral candles: [...] All candles produced by [defendant] are climate neutral. [Defendant] strives for Zero CO2 emissions and consistently ensures climate-neutrality in their company, especially through the offset of CO2 emissions. The plaintiff argued that this claim was misleading and breached  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition.

On July 2013, the Regional Court of Dusseldorf confirmed the misleading nature of the claim. It held that from a consumers point of view it was not out of question that there existed new materials or combustion techniques without CO2 emissions and that it was precisely for this reason that the defendants candles differed from other candles. But in the present case, the defendant had not explained that the candles previously described as climate-neutral were in principle interchangeable because the company was committed to environmental protection and sustainability. Thus, the product-related statement was misleading. The Regional Court reiterated that environment-related advertising claims were subject to strict requirements which can only be fulfilled if the product characteristics are clearly separated from the corporate philosophy. This had not been done in the present case  in a misleading manner. Ultimately, it held that the description of the candles as climate neutral was misleading because CO2 was released when the candles were burned.",Decided,['Germany>Dusseldorf>Regional Court of Dusseldorf'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting']",['Germany>The Act against Unfair Competition'],Whether a candle producer's advertising on 'climate neutral candles' is a misleading commercial practice,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/regional-court-of-dusseldorfs-decision-on-climate-neutral-claims-regarding-candles/
Higher Regional Court of Koblenz's decision on company's climate neutral claims regarding grave lights,"On December 2009, the Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition filed a suit against a corporation for misleading advertisement. The defendant, who sold grave lights, had advertised these on product labels and in a catalogue as climate neutral and CO2 neutral. The Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition filed a claim in the Regional Court of Koblenz arguing that the advertising claims were misleading.

On January 2011, the Regional Court of Koblenz concluded that the advertising claims CO2 neutral and climate neutral were misleading and breached  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. The Court held that consumers understood this advertising in the sense of the grave lights not having a negative impact on the CO2-content of the atmosphere. 

The defendant appealed this decision and stated that consumers understood the advertising claims CO2 neutral and climate neutral as meeting the technical requirements of these terms. The defendant argued that, in any case, they were taking measures to compensate the CO2 emissions by planting trees. 

On August 2011, the Higher Regional Court of Koblenz upheld the Regional Courts ruling. In doing so, it relied on the strict standard established by the German Federal Court of Justice on environment-related advertising claims. The Higher Regional Court insisted that climate neutrality meant complete compensation of CO2 emissions. It found that the compensation measures such as planting trees had not sufficed to achieve complete compensation, in fact, the CO2 footprint had not even been calculated. The appeal was therefore upheld under  5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition.",Decided,['Germany>Koblenz>Higher Regional Court of Koblenz'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']",['Germany>The Act against Unfair Competition'],Whether advertising on grave lights as CO2 neutral or climate neutral is a misleading commercial practice ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/higher-regional-court-of-koblenzs-decision-on-companys-climate-neutral-claims-regarding-grave-lights/
Greenpeace v. North Sea Transition Authority,"In July 2022, Greenpeace filed a legal challenge against the North Sea Transition Authoritys (previously the Oil and Gas Authority) approval of the Jackdaw gas field development project (Jackdaw). The Jackdaw field is located in the North Sea, off the east coast of Scotland, and is owned by BG International, an affiliate of Shell UK Limited. The North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA) is a private company owned by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS). 

Plans for the project were previously rejected on the grounds of potential environmental harms but were resubmitted by Shell this year. After the Offshore Petroleum Regulatory for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED), the UKs oil and gas regulatory agency, reviewed Jackdaws environmental statement and found that it would not have a significant impact on the environment, NTSA approved the project. Greenpeace claims that OPRED did not factor the CO2 emissions that would be produced by burning the gas extracted from Jackdaw in its impact assessment of the project, and therefore its approval should be revoked. According to media reports, BEIS has stated that Jackdaw will boost domestic gas supply in the years to come. In these same reports, Greenpeace has countered that there is no guarantee that the gas produced from Jackdaw will be consumed in the UK and contribute to alleviating the UKs current energy crisis, given that Shell is under no obligation to supply the UK with gas produced from the project.

R v McKelvey and others (Doctors for XR protest on Lambeth Bridge),"In April 2022, a group of approximately thirty health professionals blocked traffic on Lambeth bridge, London. They displayed a banner saying For Healths Sake. Stop Financing Fossil Fuels, to highlight the estimated 10 billion in annual  financial support the UK government gives to the fossil fuel industry. The group were present at an earlier blockade by Extinction Rebellion, which had taken place from 2pm to 4:30pm. Most protesters left by 4.30pm but the health professionals elected to block the bridge to make their own protest. Thirty minutes later, shortly after 5pm, they were arrested. 

Seven of the arrested protesters were subsequently charged with breach of section 14 of the Public Order Act 1986. That section allows police officers to place conditions on public assemblies. It is then a criminal offense to take part in a public assembly whilst knowingly failing to comply with such conditions. (Section 14 has, controversially, since been expanded by the UK government to allow noisy protest to be criminalized, but those amendments were not in force at the time of the protest on Lambeth Bridge.)

The Magistrates Court acquitted all defendants. Judge Robinson, who presided over the case, was not convinced that the necessary steps that are required for the imposition of section 14 had been taken. The Judge remarked on acquittal I was impressed by the integrity and rationality of their beliefs and their evidence was highly moving.

Anton Foley and others v Sweden (Aurora Case),"On November 25, 2022, a group of over 600 young people born between 1996 and 2015 filed a class action lawsuit against the Swedish state, arguing that Swedens action on mitigating climate change is inadequate and thus in violation of their rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). The complaint was lodged after two letters were sent to the Swedish state, one in May 2022 (to which the sitting Minister for Climate and Environment replied) and one in November 2022 following a change in government in October 2022 (to which there was no reply), where the plaintiffs outlined their requests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the risk of the negative impacts of climate change constitutes interferences with their rights to life, private and family life, and non-discrimination under articles 2, 8, and 14 of the ECHR, respectively, as well as the right to property under article 1, protocol 1 of the ECHR. These interferences are argued to constitute rights violations since Sweden is failing to do its fair share to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere to keep warming below 1.5C as compared to pre-industrial levels, by not undertaking immediate and adequate procedural and substantive measures to continuously reduce GHG emissions and enhance GHG sinks, thus failing to adequately protect the plaintiffs from adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that climate change impacts in the period leading up to 2100 will be serious, especially in relation to impacts on human health, and that they are expected to be particularly affected by these impacts because expect to be alive at that time, based on the average life span in Sweden. In terms of specific impacts, the plaintiffs cite longer and more intense heatwaves causing both mild and severe health effects, shorter and more temperate winters leading to the increased spread of diseases through ticks, and changes to precipitation patterns leading to health impacts stemming from flooding, among others. 

The plaintiffs question both procedural and substantive aspects of Swedens mitigation policy. With respect to the former, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to adopt sufficient and adequate procedural measures by not investigating, in line with the best available science: (i) the extent of Swedens fair share to reduce emissions continuously, (ii) how the fair share is to be achieved in a manner that is economically and technically feasible, and (iii) how Sweden can contribute to reduce consumption-based GHG emissions abroad, GHG emissions caused by Swedish legal persons abroad, and GHG emissions from LULUCF, as well as protecting and restoring natural carbon sinks like forests, wetlands, and oceans. The emissions in question for points (i) and (ii) are those from industrial processes, product use, fossil fuel-based energy, agriculture, and waste (IPEJA emissions).

As regards their substantive claims, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to take sufficient and adequate measures to: (i) continuously implement Swedens fair share, based on the investigations mentioned above, (ii) reduce IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 9.4 or 6.5 million tons CO2-eq annually, primarily national emissions insofar as possible, and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iii) reduce national IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 3.1 or 2.2 million tons CO2-eq annually and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iv) secure that GHG emissions reductions within one category is not achieved through increasing emissions in another category under any circumstances, and (v) continuously compensate annual emissions that exceed the permissible emissions, by reducing the net emissions by an equivalent amount in the following period under any circumstances, starting in 2019.

Ultimately, based on these arguments, the plaintiffs ask the court to order the state to implement its fair share of GHG emissions reductions to keep global warming below 1.5C, by adopting sufficient and adequate procedural and substantive measures to ensure that emissions are continuously reduced and that GHG are absorbed through natural carbon sinks, in order to limit the risk of negative impacts of climate change on them.

Residents of Omkoi v. Expert Committee on EIA Consideration and the Office of Natural Resources and Environmental Policy and Planning,"Kaboedin is an ethnic Karen community situated in a valley amidst an abundance of natural resources, whose history reflects its standing as one of the long-established indigenous highland communities in the Chiang Mai province of Thailand. In 1987, the employees of the 99 Thuwanon Company and brokers visited the Kaboedin community with the mandate to buy the villagers land. The villagers reluctantly sold their land under threat of land confiscation without compensation. Later, in 2000, the company applied for a concession certificate No. 1/2543 with the Department of Primary Industries and Mines, Ministry of Industry according to the Minerals Act B.E. 2510 (1967) (now amended to Mineral Act B.E. 2560), for a coal mining operation in Kaboedin village. Along with the application the company was required to provide an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The assessment was conducted in 2010, and the Expert Committee on EIA Consideration in the mining and extracting industry approved the EIA report of the Omkoi coal mining project on August 16, 2011. The approval was later upheld by the Expert Committee on December 29, 2020. But the locals found that the report lacked local participation and contained errors and inconsistencies regarding factual information, including forged signatures of the people. 

On discovering these facts, the representatives of Kaboedin village gathered at the Omkoi Regional Police Station to file a complaint about the falsification of the EIA report on April 5, 2020. In pursuance of fighting against the coal mining project, the community has produced a comprehensive Community Health Impact Assessment (CHIA) to highlight the flaws in the problematic EIA. A group of environmental and human rights organizations, as well as experts in various fields, also assisted the community in undertaking an evidence-based approach and scientifically analyzing the impacts. 

On April 4, 2022, fifty representatives of the Kaboedin village filed a lawsuit against the above mentioned two defendants at the Chiang Mai Administrative Court highlighting the key issues relating to:
1. The way of life of the ethnic Karen community who strives to live in the forest and natural resources
2. Health effects from the coal mining emissions
3. Loss of natural resources and the environment
4. Loss of agricultural land which will affect the community economically, as their main income is dependent on agriculture
5. The mineral transportation route would expose the community people to a risk of accidents
7. Exposure to global warming effects, as the use of energy from coal is the main cause of greenhouse gas emissions.

The plaintiffs requested the court to:
1. revoke the concession request No. 1/2543 and the Expert Committees resolution upholding the coal mining projects approval that violates the right to live in a good and safe environment for the health of the people
2. order the defendants to undertake a new EIA allowing meaningful public participation. 

As part of the lawsuit, a temporary injunction was also filed to suspend the activities through the approval. 

On September 23, 2022, the Administrative Court ordered temporary protection and suspended the activities of the coal mining project until final judgment from the Court. This order:
1. Reaffirmed the right to live in a good environment and the recognized the right to meaningful participation of the community. 
2. This is in line with the UN Human Rights Council resolution of 8 October 2021 and the UN General Assembly resolution of 28 July 2022 that certifies a clean and healthy environment. and sustainability is a human right.

RWE and Uniper v. the Netherlands (Ministry of Climate and Energy),"On November 30, 2022, the District Court of The Hague decided that energy companies RWE and Uniper could not claim financial compensation for mandatory phase-out of coal-fired electricity production. In 2019, the Dutch government had adopted the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Production Act to help implement its obligations under international climate law. The law provides that coal-fired power stations may no longer use coal as a fuel to generate electricity in the long term (by 2030 at the latest). The law aims to reduce CO2 emissions from power plants. 

The case was brought by German energy companies owning three major coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands, stating that the law infringes on their property rights because it was  introduced without offering a financial compensation scheme. The energy companies had filed claims of EUR 1.4 billion and EUR 1 billion respectively against the Dutch state, claiming the ban on coal-fired power generation by 2030 was a form of expropriation in violation of their right to property in Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the right to property in Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to European human rights law, these provisions protect the right to property of both natural and legal persons.

The District Court ruled that whilst the law indeed infringes the right to property of the energy companies, this infringement is not unlawful. In light of the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court determines whether the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Act follows the criteria for a lawful interference with the right to property. These criteria include the so-called fair balance test, encompassing consideration of the nature and scale of the interference   including whether the measure entails a de facto expropriation which would normally be eligible for compensation  and its proportionality, necessity. and foreseeability.  In terms of expropriation, the Court applied a strict test following from ECHR case-law and a previous Dutch Supreme Court ruling. Notably: de facto expropriation does not exist in situations where, even if a measure leads to the termination of the company, the entitled party retains any economic interest or a meaningful possibility to use (assets of) the company. The Court decided that there are evidently several financial interests in continued use of the power plants, including as they may be reconverted to using other fuels, such as biomass. The measure did not amount to expropriation, instead, it fell with the sphere of lawful regulation of companies, which does not necessitate compensation per se.

The District Court further decided that the measures taken by Dutch State to reduce CO2 emissions are proportional and that the interests of the owners have been sufficiently taken into account when adopting the law. According to the Court, the ban on use of coal was also foreseeable for the owners, especially if GHG emissions from power stations had not been reduced very significantly before 2020, for example by switching to biomass or by capturing CO2. Such measures were not undertaken by the companies at their MPP3 power station and the Eemshaven power station. On the other hand, the Amer power plant already runs almost entirely on biomass. The owner of the latter station could have foreseen that this power station would not be allowed to be revert back to coal once a subsidy for use of (woody) biomass terminates at the end of 2027.

The Court also attached importance to the fact that there had been significant  international and national societal debate on these issues, signaling that curbs on coal fired electricity were to be expected in the near future. Specifically, companies could not have expected new coal-fired electricity plants that were planned from 2009 onwards to operate without any limitations until 2040. In addition, the prohibition on use of coal would not take effect immediately after the entry into force of the law. Owners are given a transition period during which they can still realize revenues from coal-fired power and limit their damage. In addition, they can use this period to investigate other uses for the power plants, and invest in conversion to biomass. Overall, a fair balance was struck between the property rights of these energy companies, as associated with their coal-fired electricity plants, and the general public interest. The Prohibition on Coal in Electricity Production Act, demanding that companies phase out coal use by 2030, does not place an individual and excessive burden on the energy companies.",Decided,['Netherlands>District Court North-Holland'],"['Suits against governments>Trade and Investment>Climate-justified measures', 'Suits against governments>Energy and power']","['Netherlands>Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Production Act', 'European Convention on Human Rights', 'European Social Charter of 1961']",Whether energy companies Uniper and RWE can claim compensation for violation of their right to property under the ECHR as a result of  the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Production Act law that bans the use of coal in electricity generation by 2030.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rwe-and-uniper-v-state-of-the-netherlands-ministry-of-climate-and-energy/
The Netherlands v. RWE and Uniper (Anti-Arbitration Injunctions),"In February and April 2021, RWE and Uniper commenced ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom of the Netherlands (see RWE v. Netherlands), alleging that its decision to phase out all coal-fired power plants by 2030 violates the Netherlands obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). 

In response, the Netherlands initiated inadmissibility proceedings before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, Germany on 11 May 2021. The Netherlands argued that the arbitral proceedings of the two Germany-based companies against an EU Member State qualified as intra-EU investment arbitrations, which are incompatible with EU law. RWE and Uniper in turn argued that the German Court does not have competence to decide on the matter. 

On September 1, 2022, the Court declared both ICSID arbitral claims inadmissible pursuant to section 1032 (2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that: Until the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a request may be filed with the court to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitral proceedings. The Higher Regional Court found the arbitral clause of the ECT incompatible with EU law and thus invalid in intra-EU arbitrations. The Court relied on a number of judgements handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), including the landmark ruling in Slovak Republic v. Achmea. According to the CJEU, arbitration clauses in intra-EU investment treaties are incompatible with the principle of autonomy of the EU legal order. Disputes on EU law rest within the exclusive competence of the EU judiciary to ensure the autonomy of the legal order and consistent interpretation of Union law. 

The Courts decision can be appealed. However, in September 2022, the German governments announced that it would take over 99% of Uniper in exchange for which the company agreed to withdraw its ICSID claim against the Netherlands.

Carbon Market Watch v. FIFA,"In December 2022, Carbon Market Watch, a not-for-profit association, launched a complaint against the international governing body of association football, beach football, and futsal (FIFA) before the Belgian advertisement ethics panel. Similar claims have simultaneously been launched in France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland. Carbon Market Watch alleges that FIFA's advertising of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar as ""carbon neutral"" is misleading and false, and violates the rules of codes of the Belgian advertisement ethics panel. In particular, they argue that the ""carbon neutral"" nature of this World Cup has not been certified or validated by any independent body, that the methodology used by FIFA to measure its ""carbon neutrality"" was erroneous and resulted in a significant underestimation, and that FIFA also failed to meet its obligations in terms of offsetting to support its carbon neutrality communication.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe v. Germany,"Volkswagen AG, a German company, used a technology on some of its cars to control and reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The software operating the exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system was programmed in such a way that, under normal conditions of use, the EGR rate was reduced. In its European Comission (EC) type-approval procedure, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, the KBA) found that the software constituted a defeat device prohibited by Regulation No 715/2007. Volkswagen updated the software by setting the EGR valve so exhaust gas purification was fully effective only when the outside temperature was greater than 15 C. The KBA approved that temperature window in its decision of June 20, 2016. 

Deutsche Umwelthilfe started a legal proceeding against Germany challenging the softwares authorization before the Administrative Court in Schleswig-Holstein, contending that the approved temperature window constituted a defeat device prohibited by the law of the European Union (EU law). The administrative court decided that Deutsche Umwelthilfe lacked standing to bring the challenge under German law. The court asked the Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) in a preliminary reference whether the environmental organization might have standing based directly on EU law, in particular the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters, read in conjunction with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The administrative court also ruled that the temperature window constitutes a defeat device but asked the ECJ whether the window can be justified under the exception in Regulation No 715/2007 that the need for the device is justified in terms of protecting the engine against damage or accident and for safe operation of the vehicle. 

On November 8, 2022, the ECJ answered that an administrative decision relating to EC type-approval, which may be contrary to EU law, falls within the material scope of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, since it constitutes an act of a public authority that is alleged to contravene the national environmental provisions. An environmental association has standing under Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention if it meets the conditions under national law to bring legal proceedings. The ECJ also notes that member states must comply with the right to an effective remedy, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter, when establishing the applicable procedural rules. Member states cannot impose criteria so strict that it would be impossible for environmental associations to challenge the acts or omissions that are the subject of the Aarhus Convention. The ECJ concluded that Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, precludes a situation where such an association is unable to challenge a decision granting or amending EC type-approval which may be contrary to EU law. A defeat device can be justified by a need to protect the engine against damage or accident and for the safe operation of the vehicle. The ECJ held that such a justification only exists if the device strictly meets the need to avoid immediate risks of damage or accident to the engine of such a serious nature as to give rise to a specific hazard when a vehicle fitted with that device is driven. The need for such a defeat device exists only if no other technical solution makes it possible to avoid the above mentioned risks. The opposite conclusion could result in the exception being applied more frequently than the prohibition and would result in a disproportionate infringement of the principle of limiting nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.

"Yesil Artvin Dernegi and others v. Presidency of the Republic of Turkiye, Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change and Energy Market Regulatory Authority","The applicants, as sixteen environmental NGOs, before filing the case at hand, made an application before the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey, requesting the annulment of the licenses of thirty-seven active coal thermal power plants in Turkey. The basis for this application is the scientific reports stating that the pandemics such as the recent coronavirus pandemic is a result of global climate change. Accordingly, it is alleged that the coal mines and thermal power plants play a leading role for climate change and therefore, their activities must be terminated. The Presidency of the Republic of Turkiye didnt respond to this application in sixty days, which is deemed as a tacit rejection under Administrative Judicial Procedure Act. The applicants filed the case at hand in December 2020 and requested the annulment of the tacit rejection of the Presidency. 

Presidency of Republic of Turkiye stated in its defense, the authority to annul the license for the power plants belongs to the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change and Energy Market Regulatory Authority. Energy Market Regulatory Authority, in its defense, referred that the relevant authority for environmental assessments is the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. Finally, the Ministry alleged that there is no scientific proof on the relationship between climate change, pandemics and coal power plants. 

The Court rejected the case depending on (1) that the allegations made by the claimants does not constitute a legal ground for the annulment of the license of the power plant and (2) the claimants havent initiated any legal procedures against the production license, environmental assessment report and the documents on environmental permitting and license. In its decision dated 28 March 2022, The Court also stated that the license which has been granted in accordance with the legal regulations cannot be annulled upon abstract grounds and therefore the tacit rejection by the Presidency cannot be deemed illegal. 

The case has been brought before the Regional Administrative Courts by the Claimants for appeal and on February 2023, this appeal has been rejected on the ground that the decision given by 11th Administrative Court of Ankara is found to be lawful.

Finnish Association for Nature Conservation and Greenpeace v. Finland,"Finland's Climate Act (423/2022) was amended to include new provisions on the climate plans of municipalities and on appeals concerning decisions made under the Climate Act. According to section 16 of the Finnish Climate Act, [t]he Government shall monitor the implementation of the climate policy plans [...] adequately to determine whether the targets concerning climate change mitigation and adaptation set out in the plans and the objectives referred to [...] will be achieved. On the basis of the monitoring, the Government shall, if necessary, decide on the additional measures required to achieve the targets. The new Climate Change Act sets a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035  a target recommended by Finlands Climate Council. With the new law, there is now a legal obligation to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. However, the collapse of Finlands carbon sinks in 2021 has created a situation where the governments climate policy plans are insufficient for meeting the Climate Acts targets. The reason is due to the intensive forest logging and the slowing down of forest growth that has become a source of greenhouse emissions.

The Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) and Greenpeace filed an appeal at the Supreme Administrative Court in Finland alleging a breach of the Finnish Climate Act, essentially claiming that the Finnish Government has neglected its duty to properly assess and decide on the need for additional measures pertaining to climate change mitigation when it decided to provide the Finnish Parliament with the Annual Climate Report. The environmental groups argued that the government had ignored its own laws by failing to protect the Nordic nation's carbon sinks which have fallen below the climate plans and to comply with the Climate Act, hence, the environmental groups demanded that the Finnish Governments decision with respect to the Annual Climate Report 2022 be revoked and sent back to preparation. 
The environmental organizations specifically refer to the obligations under the Paris Agreement, arguing that Greenpeace and the Finnish Nature Conservation Union believe it is important to seek guidance from the court on whether the monitoring and updating of the progress of climate action works as it should according to the law and the parliament intention to act in the light of the statements. At the same time, it is the first time that more effective implementation of climate measures is demanded in Finland through legal channels. 

In the judgment on 7.6.2023, the court found the case to be inadmissible on procedural grounds. The Courts majority based its ruling on the well-established principle in Finnish administrative law that inaction does not constitute grounds for an administrative appeal, thereby finding the case inadmissible. The Court also emphasized:

""According to best available science, climate change is a question of humanity's fate, which threatens the living conditions of current and future generations on Earth, unless quick and effective measures are taken in terms of maintaining and increasing emission limits and carbon sinks. Therefore, postponing action shifts the responsibility into the future and makes it difficult to achieve the maximum 1.5 degree temperature goal enshrined in the Paris Agreement. The primary responsibility for fulfilling international [climate] obligations rests with democratically elected political decision makers. It is the court's job to ensure, on the basis of an appeal, that the decisions of political decision-makers are in accordance with the law and do not prevent the realization of human and fundamental rights.""",Decided,['Finland>Supreme Administrative Court'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment']",['Finland'],Whether the Finnish government has ignored its commitments to mitigate GHG emissions under Finnish law. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/finnish-association-for-nature-conservation-and-greenpeace-v-finland/

Notre Affaire a tous v. FIFA,"In November 2022, Notre Affaire A Tous, a not-for-profit association, filed a complaint with the Jury de Deontologie Publicitaire (French advertisement ethics self-regulatory organization) for misleading advertising (greenwashing) against the International Association Football Federation (FIFA). Similar complaints for misleading advertising have been filed in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands to challenge the carbon neutrality claims of the Qatar World Cup. These complaints allege that FIFA has made a commitment to consumers and spectators to organize a carbon neutral tournament by reducing and offsetting GHG emissions. 

Specifically, Notre Affaire a Tous claims that 

	There is a lack of clarity of the statements advertised regarding environmental and climate performance of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar presented by FIFA. FIFA presents short and punchy messages, using superlatives on several occasions by calling the World Cup ""the most compact"" and ""the most carbon-neutral in history"". To be accurate, however, such messages must be supported in a way that is understandable and comprehensible for the public to which they are addressed (section 4 of the ARPP's Recommendation on sustainable development), especially in complex systems such as those presented here (section 9 of the Recommendation on sustainable development).

	Such statements are false as shown report by the NGO Carbon Market Watch, which found that the carbon neutrality claims made by the FIFA were based on a considerable underestimation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the organization of the World Cup.

	On its website, FIFA claims that the World Cup in Qatar will be ""the most compact in history"" or ""the most compact edition of the competition since 1930"". This claim is based on the reduced distance between the stadiums, which will ""significantly reduce carbon emissions caused by transportation, teams, officials and fans"", and result in ""the elimination of domestic flights during the competition."" Notre Affaires a Tous claims that these allegations are false in light of the promotion of ""shuttle flights"" by several airlines in the Gulf region, which shuttled fans residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, or Muscat, Oman. 

	FIFA has chosen to ""green"" the carbon footprint of the 2022 World Cup by using ""carbon offsetting"" mechanisms that are not in line with international standards. Notre Affaire a Tous claim explains that offsetting should normally be a last resort, if emissions cannot be reduced. Notre Affaire a Tous therefore considers that these carbon neutrality claims are likely to mislead soccer fans, partners, consumers and the five billion or so spectators expected to be watching on television.

The relevant authorities in Belgium, France, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Switzerland announced that all five complaints would be examined jointly by the Swiss authorities.

"Fabiano Contarato, Randolph Rodrigues and Joenia Batista v. Ricardo Salles","On August 22, 2019, two congressmen, Fabiano Contarato and Randolph Rodrigues, and one congresswoman, Joenia Batista, filed a petition before the Federal Supreme Court to investigate political-administrative infractions leading to high crimes and misdemeanors (crime de responsabilidade) against Ricardo Salles, then-Minister of Environment of Brazil. The plaintiffs maintain that the public management of the defendant, as the head of the Ministry, was incompatible with the probity and decorum required of leaders in office. Among other decisions and omissions considered undignified, they allege the violation of international commitments ratified by the Brazilian government to combat climate change, in particular the Paris Agreement. They claim that the ministerial policy implemented by the defendant has not been proactive in achieving Brazil's targets for reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). They affirm, in this sense, a lack of commitment to combating the illegal deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest. They also state that the budget of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) has been cut, compromising its environmental monitoring and enforcement activities. Finally, they request that the then-Minister of the Environment be recognized as having committed high crimes and misdemeanors (crime de responsabilidade) and that he be removed from office and disqualified from holding public office for eight years.

On October 24, 2019, Justice Edson Fachin held that the plaintiffs lacked legal standing and determined that the case should be dismissed. The plaintiffs then filed an Interlocutory Appeal in which they repeated the terms of the Petition, emphasizing that its legitimacy is supported by Article 14 of the Law of High Crimes and Misdemeanors (Lei dos Crimes de Responsabilidade  Law 1.079/1950), which allows any citizen to denounce a Minister of the State.

Institute of Amazonian Studies v. Federal Union and Federal Environmental Agencies (IBAMA and ICMBio) (Chico Mendes Extraction Reserve),"On October 28, 2022, the Institute of Amazonian Studies (Instituto de Estudos Amazonicos (IEA)) filed a Public Civil Action (class action) against the Federal Union and Federal Environmental Agencies (Brazilian Institute of the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio)). It states that deforestation causes irreparable damage to the Amazon Rainforest and affects the rights and way of life of the traditional extractivist community, which is based on the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. The action emphasizes that the Chico Mendes Extraction Reserve (RESEx) is an instrument of social justice and a vehicle for forest protection. It claims that the advance of deforestation has occurred due to the weakening of public policies, land invasion, road construction, density of access roads, and fires in the region, among other reasons. According to the plaintiff, beginning in 2019, there has been a drastic increase in deforestation. The RESEx Utilization Plan states that deforestation in areas with rubber plantations cannot exceed 10% of the area, and the action claims that this limit has been exceeded in approximately half of those areas. The IEA emphasizes that RESEx has a strategic role in providing environmental services to the inhabitants of the Acre River basin due to the supply of water. It also highlights the deforestation reduction targets for the Legal Amazon region in the Amazon Deforestation Prevention and Control Plan (PPCDAm) foreseen in Federal Law 12.187/2009 (National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC)), which, according to the IEA, are not being met. It points out that, as the Federal Union, IBAMA and ICMBio are not fulfilling their duty of management and control and are contributing to the damage to the RESEx and the community. It emphasizes the vital role of the forest in the carbon cycle and that approximately three million tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere due to illegal deforestation in the RESEx. The IEA argues that there is a need for full environmental reparation in addition to the obligation to restore the forest and argues that future studies should be done to calculate the compensation for associated damages, such as climate damage. It emphasizes the vulnerable situation of the community, which justifies the payment of compensation for collective moral damage. It also argues that there is a need to prepare a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan for the region. Finally, among the other claims, the author requests: (i) payment of compensation for the material damage caused to the environment in the amount of at least R$ 183,817,104.00; (ii) payment of compensation for collective moral damage in the minimum amount of R$ 100,000,000.00; and (iii) immediate forest restoration of the entire area deforested above the established limit, to be carried out according to a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan.",Pending,['Brazil>Acre>2nd Federal Civil and Criminal Court of the Judiciary Section of Acre'],['Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems'],"['Brazil>National Policy for the Sustainable Development of Traditional Peoples and Communities (Federal Decree 6.040/2007)', 'Brazil>Law 9.605/1998', 'Brazil>ILO Convention 169 (enacted by Decree 5051/2004', 'Brazil>National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12', 'Brazil>United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Federal Decree 2652/1998)', 'Brazil>Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9073/2017', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 5', 'Brazil>Federal Law 9 985/2000 (National System of Nature Conservation Units  SNUC)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 23', 'Brazil>Action Plan for Prevention and Control of the Legal Amazon Deforestation (PPCDAm)', 'Brazil>National Environmental Policy Act (Law No. 6.938 of 1981)']","Seeking to prevent the continuation of illegal deforestation in the Chico Mendes Extractive Reserve (RESEx), to recover the deforested areas and to hold the defendants responsible for their failure to protect the environment.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/institute-of-amazonian-studies-v-federal-union-and-federal-environmental-agencies-ibama-and-icmbio-chico-mendes-extraction-reserve/
Request for an advisory opinion on the scope of the state obligations for responding to the climate emergency,"On January 9, 2023, Chile and Colombia signed a joint advisory opinion request to be presented before the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR), aiming to clarify the scope of the state obligations for responding to the climate emergency under the frame of international human rights law. The request acknowledged the human rights effects of the climate emergency, especially highlighting the vulnerability of communities and ecosystems in Latin America. In this line, Colombia and Chile emphasized the need for regional standards to accelerate action to confront climate change. The applicants mentioned the Advisory Opinion OC-23/17 requested by Colombia, where the IACtHR recognized the right to a healthy environment and the relation between environment and human rights. The request identifies the IACtHR as the suitable body to determine guidelines for creating and implementing climate policies based on a human rights approach. 

Colombia and Chile's petition refers to various topics. First, the applicants asked about the state obligations derived from preventing and guaranteeing human rights to confront climate emergencies. In this sense, the applicants enquired the Court about the scope of the prevention duty of states against extreme and slow onset climate effects in the light of the Paris Agreement and the scientific consensus not to trespass the 1.5 degrees of global temperature. Along the same line, the applicants asked about which actions states should take against the damages provoked by climate impacts and which differentiated measures should be taken to protect vulnerable communities. Specifically, Colombia and Chile requested the Court to refer to actions regarding regulation, monitoring, environmental impact assessment, contingency plans and mitigation of activities that can worsen the climate emergency. In this line, the applicants asked the IACtHR about the principles that should 'inspire' these actions, especially regarding adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage. 

Second, the requesting states focused on the state obligation to preserve the right to life against the climate emergency in the light of human rights and science standards. Here, the applicants requested an opinion regarding the scope of substantive and procedural obligations on human rights and the environment. The applicants especially asked the Court about the importance of protecting the right to access information to guarantee other human rights, such as the right to life, property, health and participation. 

Third, the applicants requested an opinion from the Court to clarify the differentiated obligations of the states to protect the rights of children and future generations from climate change. Here, Colombia and Chile mentioned articles 1, 4, 5, 11 and 19 of the American Convention and asked about the nature and scope of the right of children to access justice to present judicial actions for preventing potentially damaging effects of climate change. 

Fourth, following the clarification of the scope of procedural obligations, Chile and Colombia asked the IACtHR to clarify the nature of the obligations of the states to provide judicial actions for adequate protection and reparation of the rights affected by the climate emergency. In the same sense, the applicants asked about the necessity to implement the obligation to consult for the climate consequences of certain activities.

Fifth, the applicants focused on environmental defenders' protection, referring to the American Convention and the Escazu Agreement. Here, the applicants focused on the obligations that states should comply with for protecting environmental defenders, especially indigenous people and women, for protecting ecosystems in the context of the climate emergency. 

Finally, Colombia and Chile focused on asking the IACtHR about the cooperation between states to confront climate change in the region, especially to clarify the shared and differentiated obligations amongst the region's nations. Here, the questions highlight the need for guidelines to clarify states' role in guaranteeing reparation measures by considering equity and climate justice principles. In addition, the applicants enquired about their actions to confront the migration triggered and exacerbated by climate effects in the region.

Industrie de bois de Vielsalm &amp; Cie v. Walloon Region,"The European Union adopted Directive 2004/8/EC to promote high-efficiency cogeneration and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Under the Directive, Member States are to adopt certain supporting mechanisms to encourage cogeneration. In implementing the Directive, Walloon decided to exclude biomass from wood, because of the potentially negative environmental consequences. Industrie de bois de Vielsalm (IBV), which operates a cogeneration plant from sawmill waste, applied to the Walloon Government for green certificates under the support mechanism and was rejected. IBV challenged the refusal arguing that the exclusion of biomass from wood (1) was inconsistent with the Directive and (2) violated the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The Constitutional Court of Belgium referred these issues to the EU Court of Justice. The Court of Justice found Walloon's interpretation of biomass was permissible under the Directive given its purpose. Furthermore, the Court found that while Member States were subject to the equal treatment and non-discrimination clauses of EU's Charter of Fundamental Rights in implementing the cogeneration support mechanism, the Walloon Government did not defy those clauses when it excluded wood and wood waste from its biomass support scheme.",Decided,['European Union>European Court of Justice'],"['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading']",['European Union>Secondary Law>Directives'],Whether the Swiss government's climate change mitigation targets and implementation measures were adequate under EU Directive 2004/8/EC.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/industrie-de-bois-de-vielsalm-cie-v-walloon-region/

Federal Public Prosecutors Office v. Ricardo Salles and Federal Union,"On July 6, 2020, the Federal Public Prosecutors Office (MPF) filed a Civil Action for Administrative Improbity, with a request for precautionary removal from office, against Ricardo Salles, at the time Minister of Environment of Brazil, claiming the practice of intentional acts that violated the constitutional duty to protect the environment. It states that the former Minister, through actions, omissions, practices, and speeches, promoted the dismantling of environmental policies, favoring unlawful interests in violation of the constitutional principles that guide the Public Administration. The MPF raises a vast set of acts by the former Minister that they allege have contributed to the intentional dismantling of environmental protection, based on four main aspects: (i) regulatory measures; (ii) transparency and participation measures; (iii) budget measures; and (iv) monitoring measures. As for normative dismantling, climate is highlighted regarding the extinction of the Secretariat of Climate Change and Forests. The MPF claiming that such an act would signal that the combating climate change is not a priority of the Federal Government and would distance Brazil from its international and national climate commitments. Regarding the budget dismantling, it questions the reduction of resources allocated to the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the paralysis of the Amazon Fund due to the extinction of the operational and guiding bodies. The Amazon Fund is dedicated to financing REDD+ actions linked to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and the MPF mentions its paralysis influences in lack of financing and implementation of the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC. The increase in deforestation and the Ministry's lack of action to combat it are associated with the failure to comply with climate commitments and deforestation reduction targets. Given a broad picture of dismantling of the protection of the environment, the MPF requested, as a preliminary injunction, the precautionary removal of Ricardo Salles from the post of Minister of the Environment, with a definitive request that the acts questioned be declared unlawful and as to sentence him to loss of public office.

The first instance judge denied the preliminary injunction request.  

In its reply, the Federal Government denied the existence of any wrongdoing by the former minister Ricardo Salles. It alleged the principle of separation of powers, affirming the inadmissibility of a lawsuit questioning the choice of the President regarding the appointment of public positions of trust. It emphasized that the acts questioned by the MPF are decisions of administrative merit, within the scope of the competencies of the public manager to direct public policies.

ONG Costa Legal and others vs. Municipality of Florianopolis and others,"On May 19, 2021, three NGOs, ONG Costa Legal, UFECO and Associacao Pachamama filed an Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) seeking structural measures to protect the Conceicao Lagoon, located in Florianopolis, Santa Catarina. Later, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Santa Catarina (MPSC) and the Associacao Nacional dos Atingidos por Barragens (ANAB) joined the plaintiffs. The environmental class-action was filed against the Municipality of Florianopolis; the Municipal Environment Foundation (FLORAM); the State of Santa Catarina; the Santa Catarina Environmental Institute (IMA/SC); the Santa Catarina Water and Sanitation Company (CASAN); and the Santa Catarina Public Services Regulation Agency (ARESC).

The lawsuit seeks the implementation of a socio-ecological governance system for the protection, control, monitoring and inspection of the ecological integrity of the Conceicao Lagoon. The plaintiffs present the Conceicao Lagoon as the subject of ecological rights and claim that, due to the organized irresponsibility of the current institutional structure, there is an unconstitutional state of affairs. They point out that there is, in its surroundings, a complex mosaic of dunes, sandbanks and forests, part of the Atlantic Forest biome. They explain the importance of the ecosystem services provided by the lagoon, especially for a greater capacity to adapt to climate change of the surrounding ecosystems and communities, which are more vulnerable to the effects of global temperature increase. The plaintiffs emphasize the role of the Lagoon for the local socio-cultural history, highlighting the importance of water quality for the identity of the communities in the region. They claim that the risks of perishing and collapse of the Lagoon's ecosystem are evident and urgent, generating violations of fundamental rights. They allege structural problems related to ineffective governance by the responsible actors. They claim that the impacts of human activities on ecological systems threaten diverse forms of life and are a matter of ecological justice. Finally, the plaintiffs request, among other things the recognition of the active legitimacy of the associations to claim, besides the protection of the collective right to the environment, the protection of the rights of the Conceicao Lagoon. They seek a declaration of the Lagoon as a natural entity with specific rights. Also, they request the recognition of a structural problem which requires the institution of a Judicial Chamber for the Protection of the Conceicao Lagoon (CJ-PLC); and, based on its findings, the establishment of a Judicial Plan for the Protection of Conceicao Lagoon (PJ-PLC). 

A preliminary injunction was granted, determining the creation of the CJ-PLC, with the purpose of advising the Court in the adoption of structural measures necessary to guarantee the ecological integrity of the Lagoon as a natural entity. The Chamber is to be composed by the defendants and interested parties. In addition, the decision welcomed the inclusion of the Federal Public Prosecutors' Office (MPF) and the Public Prosecutors' Office of Santa Catarina (MPSC) as plaintiffs. The decision was appealed, and the Court of Appeal conclude that the CJ-PLC is not equivalent to a state agency; it does not have decision-making power or the power to impose obligations on any party to the proceedings. It clarifies that the CJ-PLC does not enjoy the prerogative of using public resources and is merely consultative nature to to advise the Court on issues that have already been litigated.",pending,['Brazil>Santa Catarina (SC)'],['Suits against governments>Protecting biodiveristy and ecosystems'],"['Brazil>Forest Code (Law 12 651/2012)', 'National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12', '187/2009)', 'Brazil>National Policy on Climate Change  PNMC (Federal Law 12', 'Federal Constitution (arts. 5', 'Forest Code (Law 12.651/2012)', 'Federal Law 12.651/12 (Forest Code)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225', 'Brazil>PNMC (Federal Law 12 187/2009)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 5', 'Brazil>Atlantic Forest Protection Law (Law 11 428/06)']",NGO's seek the declaration of rights of the Conceicao Lagoon and structural measures to protect it.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ong-costa-legal-and-others-vs-municipality-of-florianopolis-and-others/
Instituto Internacional Arayara vs. National Electrical Energy Agency and Brazil,"On September 27, 2022, the NGO, Instituto Internacional Arayara filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) against National Agency of Electrical Energy (ANEEL) and the Federal Government to challenge the implementation of ANEEL Auction N 08/2022, which aims to hire energy from gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The Auction results from the Federal Law 14.182/2022, which determined the privatization of Brazilian Energy Company Eletrobras, but whose legislative process included the insertion of unrelated content, determining the contracting of energy from gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The plaintiff alleges that the climate crisis is incompatible with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that will be generated by the thermoelectric plants, which could lead to a 39% increase in annual GHG emissions for the electricity sector compared to the levels registered in 2021. It points to several negative impacts associated with the projects of gas-fired thermoelectric plants to be installed in areas of the Legal Amazon. They will generate socio-environmental impacts on traditional communities, native peoples, and protected areas; compromise the use of local water resources, due to the high water-use; and increase the price of electricity for consumers. This would worsen climate change and violate the National Environmental Policy Act (Federal Law 6.938/1981), the National Climate Change Policy (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the Paris Agreement, and compromise the achievement of the Brazilian NDC. It is requested, as a preliminary injunction: (i) the suspension of ANEEL Auction or the suspension of its effects; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, it is requested that the defendants submit an inventory of GHG emissions from all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC. In final, it is requested: (i) the cancellation of Auction no 008/2022, with the annulment of all its effects and the determination that no new similar auction be held on the basis of Federal Law 14,182/2022; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, that the defendants be required, definitively, to submit an inventory of GHG emissions of all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC.

While the District Court found that the entering of the site fulfilled the elements of the crime under Section 123 (1) of the German Criminal Code, it was neither unlawful nor without authority, as the defendant exercised his fundamental rights under Art. 8(1)  freedom of assembly; Art. 5 (1)(1)  freedom of expression and Art. 4(3)  freedom of conscience of the Basic Law.

The District Court held that climate change was an issue of paramount importance. The political decision to cease lignite mining  an activity recognised as harmful  and the subsequent decision to delay its phase-out nonetheless, could, in the words of the Court, place individuals in a state of moral dilemma, wishing to protest against it.

Allhoff-Cramer v. Volkswagen AG,"In November 2021, an organic farmer sued Volkswagen AG (VW) for its excessive emissions of carbon dioxide. The plaintiff submits that Volkswagens business activities are adversely impacting his personal liberty and property rights. He submits that VW, as the worlds second largest car manufacturer is partly responsible for the damage climate change has caused to his farm in the form of droughts and heavy rains. Claimant argues that VWs sale of millions of cars, exacerbates the climate crisis, causing future losses.

Amongst others, the claimants seeks a declaration that between 2021 and 2029 Volkswagen, a maximum of 25% of its passenger cars and light commercial vehicles sold may operate on an internal combustion engine, and from 2030 onwards none at all.

Fridays for Future v. Augsburg,"In July 2020, Fridays for Future Augsburg set up a climate camp next to the citys town hall that was later disbanded by the city. Activists challenged the citys action. During the proceedings, the city submitted that the climate camp was not an assembly, as protected by Article 8 of the German Basic Law (Grundgesetz; GG), but rather that fun and entertainment were the motivating factor. 

In spring 2022, the Higher Administrative Court of Bavaria (BayVGH) upheld the judgment by a lower court, which had already found that the climate camp constituted an assembly under Art. 8 GG. The BayVGH held that Art. 8 GG protects diverse forms of communal activity aimed at forming public opinion. This also includes non-verbal forms of expression, activities such as poster painting and workshops, or engaging with politicians in the framework of the camp. The city of Augsburg criticized the Court for only considering the first ten days of the camp July 1-10, 2020), which were the subject of the dispute, and for not making more general statements on the legality of permanent protest camps.

ClientEarth v. Shell's Board of Directors,"On February 9, 2023, ClientEarth filed a derivative action against Shell's Board of Directors alleging mismanaging of material and foreseeable climate risk and breach of company law. The claim is supported by institutional investors collectively holding over 12 million shares in the company, and more than half a trillion US dollars (450 billion) in total assets under management (AUM). The group of investors includes, among others, UK pension funds Nest and London CIV, Swedish national pension fund AP3, French asset manager Sanso IS, Degroof Petercam Asset Management (DPAM) in Belgium, as well as Danske Bank Asset Management and pension funds Danica Pension and AP Pension in Denmark. ClientEarth, which is bringing the lawsuit in its capacity as a shareholder, notified the Board of its claim in a pre-action letter in March 2022.

The lawsuit alleges Shells 11 directors have breached their legal duties under the Companies Act by failing to adopt and implement an energy transition strategy that aligns with the Paris Agreement. While Shell claims that its ""Energy Transition Strategy,"" which includes a net zero emissions plan with a 2050 target, is consistent with the 1.5C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. However, ClientEarth, based on a third-party assessment done by Climate Action 100+, claims that the strategy excludes short to medium-term targets to cut the emissions from scope 3 emissions despite these accounting for more than 90% of the companys overall emissions. The groups net emissions are calculated to fall by just 5% by 2030, which does not comply with the Dutch Court's 2021 <a href=""https://climatecasechart.com/wp-content/uploads/non-us-case-documents/2021/20210526_8918_judgment-1.pdf"">order</a> order to reduce emissions by 45% in group-wide emissions by the end of this decade. ClientEarth alleges that the Boards failure to fully comply with the Dutch Courts judgment is also a breach of its legal duties. Shell has appealed the judgment. The Boards strategy also entails continued overinvestment in new fossil fuel projects, contrary to the recommendations of the International Energy Agency.  

Under UK company law, Shells Board has a legal duty to promote the success of the company and to act with reasonable care, skill and diligence. ClientEarth argues that the Board is breaching those requirements if it is not properly managing climate risk. 

ClientEarth has asked the High Court for an Order which requires the Board to adopt a strategy to manage climate risk in line with its duties under the Companies Act, and in compliance with the Dutch Court judgment. t is now up to the High Court to decide whether to grant ClientEarth permission to bring the claim.

Municipality of Maria Pinto and Others v. National Forest Corporation (CONAF) and Ministry of Environment,"On September 10, 2021, the Municipality of Maria Pinto and its residents filed a constitutional action against the National Forest Corporation (CONAF) and the Ministry of Environment. In their claim, the plaintiffs requested the protection of the people living in Maria Pinto from farming projects approved by CONAF, which failed to meet the standards required by environmental and land-use planning legislation. According to the plaintiffs, their constitutional rights, as recognized in Article 19, have been violated, including the right to life, the right to a pollution-free environment, and the right to property ownership. By failing to take action, the Ministry of Environment is also in breach of its obligations. 

Plaintiffs point out that Maria Pinto was declared a water scarcity area by Supreme Decree No. 157, which was issued on December 31, 2019 and remains in force today. The decree states that the geographical features of the municipality make it highly vulnerable to flooding resulting from episodes of heavy rainfall. Maria Pinto is also recognized as an Area of Flood Risk and Protection of Natural Watercourses and Water Bodies, which is an area particularly affected by the overflow of riverbeds and estuaries that strips away natural protection due to erosion of the banks of these watercourses. Finally, the decree states that Maria Pinto is located in an area of high vulnerability to climate change, with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as droughts and floods. This has led to an increase in the risk of water scarcity and an increase in the risk of flooding.

The petitioners are requesting that the respondents take measures to ensure that agricultural activity is planned responsibly and sustainably. They are asking for a soil recovery and water planning program to be established, which would help to protect the human right to water and comply with CONAF's National Climate Change and Plant Resources Strategy for the period 2017-2025. The petitioners are also asking that the effects of climate change be taken into consideration when granting sectorial permits for avocado plantations, which is currently not being done. This would help to mitigate the environmental impacts of avocado production, such as soil erosion and reduced water infiltration, and would help to reduce the crop's water footprint.

The respondents requested dismissal of the action, arguing that the remedy was requested past the deadline and that a trial was the only way to resolve the matter. As a result, they argue that the appeal should be rejected because they acted within the legal framework. According to the defendants, the land is covered by the native forest recovery and forestry promotion regime under Articles 5 and 16 of Law No. 20.283, which does not require management plans to include the climate considerations demanded by the appellants.

The court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, finding that the defendants had failed to comply with the legal requirements for the management of the land. The court found that the defendants had not taken into account the climate considerations required by the law, and that the land was not being managed in accordance with the law. The court ordered the defendants to develop a new management plan that takes into account the climate considerations required by the law.

On December 2, 2022, CONAF appealed the ruling and requested that it be set aside on the ground that the constitutional guarantees alleged by the appellants had not been violated.

Ricardo Castillo Arancibia v. Municipality of Monte Patria,"As described in the lawsuit filed on February 4, 2022, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant the Municipality of Monte Patria in May 2017 for services related to the Department of the Environment, where he maintained the city's gardens and public spaces, kept a record of the city plants, and trees, and shrub needs, and designed gardens for public spaces and schools. It was initially fixed until December 31, 2017 and then renewed every three months based on the evaluation of the person in charge of the Department. There were successive renewals of contracts until 31 December 2019. 

On January 2, 2020, the Municipality amended his contract, assigning him the tasks of ""planning the recovery of public spaces, designing and executing projects for green areas under its Environment Director"". Upon November 30, 2021, the defendant notified him of the termination of his contract (""non-renewal""), and he was dismissed on December 31, 2021. According to the plaintiff, he was dismissed for political reasons and due to a discriminatory act by the defendant.

According to the municipality, the complaint should be rejected. It states that since the employee is a public worker, the termination does not have to be justified since the contract's expiration suffices. It is claimed, however, that the termination of the contract was due to a restructuring of the Department of the Environment, as extreme drought requires actions that favour the sustainable use of water resources and address the drought in Monte Patria, which requires different planning than what has been done so far by the plaintiff.

Due to the fixed-term nature of the contract, the Ovalle District Court rejected the claim, stating that the defendant municipality did not have to justify its termination. As for climate change, it maintains that the separation of the plaintiff was caused by an administrative reorganization affecting the unit or department where the plaintiff worked, such as Environment. The judgment indicates that the prolonged drought affecting the province and much of the country is public knowledge, so it seems reasonable to adopt measures to optimize water resources and reduce green areas of the commune, which happens to be the operational area of the plaintiff both in planning, monitoring and care; and this measure has justified the rationing of human resources for the plaintiff's responsibilities.

The plaintiff filed an action for annulment before the Court of Appeals for the City of La Serena. According to him, the dismissal was unjustified and politically motivated. Regarding the argument that the Department of the Environment should be restructured, he maintains that the climate crisis has been around the city for over 20 years, and that his work focuses specifically on water resource optimization, which demonstrates the weakness of the Municipality's argument.

The Court of Appeals of La Serena dismissed the appeal without addressing the defendant's climate change argument. A new legal recourse for unification of jurisprudence was filed by the plaintiff against this judgment before the Supreme Court.

Belgische Federatie der Brandstoffenhandelaars vzw and Others and Lamine v. Flemish Government,"On 22 October 2021, the Region of Flanders adopted the Decree ""amending the Energy Decree of 8 May 2009, which prohibits the installation or replacement of a fuel oil boiler."" This Decree introduced a ban from 1 January 2022 on the installation of fuel oil boilers in new buildings. From that date, an oil boiler may no longer be installed or replaced by another oil boiler in existing buildings, unless there is no natural gas network in the adjacent street. The non-profit association ""Belgian Federation of Fuel Traders,"" four fuel oil suppliers, and a private individual who heats their home with a fuel oil boiler jointly sought the annulment of this Decree before the Belgian Constitutional Court (request no. 147/2022).

The complainants alleged that (i) the Region of Flanders exceeded the limits of its competences (in violation of the complex distribution of competences in Belgium as a federal State), (ii) that the Decree discriminates against fuel oil boilers and hinders free trade and freedom of enterprise, and (iii) that the Decree discriminates against fuel oil boiler owners depending on whether they live in a street where a natural gas network is available. The Constitutional Court rejected all three grounds for annulment in its Judgment of 10 November 2022.

As to the first ground for annulment, the Court noted that the measure at issue did not, as was argued by the complainants, have ""a market-exclusive effect"" and, therefore, did not fall within the (exclusive) competence of the Federal Government. 

With regards to the second ground for annulment, the Court found that the difference of treatment created by the measure at issue pursued a legitimate objective of public interest, namely, environmental and climate protection. It referred to a preliminary scientific study conducted by the Flemish legislator, which showed that in 2019 fuel oil in the Flemish Region corresponded to a share of 35% in the greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and a share of 10% in greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the European emissions trading system. Furthermore, this scientific study showed that the phasing out of fuel oil boilers could make a significant contribution to Flemish emission reduction in the short and long term and that the emission factor for fuel oil is considerably higher than for natural gas, propane, and butane gas. Therefore, the Court considered that the legislator could decide that a mere incentive through premiums and awareness-raising would not suffice and opt to phase out only fuel oil boilers as a first step. 

Finally, the Court also rejected the third ground for annulment because the prohibition in principle on the installation and replacement of fuel oil boilers has positive effects on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the soil, and the legislator has taken into account the impact of this ban on owners of existing installations by setting up a partial phase-out, focusing the ban on the most polluting heating installations, and giving owners of fuel oil boilers the possibility to switch to natural gas, thus offering them a viable alternative.

As a consequence, the request for annulment was rejected.",decided,['Belgium>Belgian Constitutional Court'],['Suits against governments'],['Belgium>Belgian Constitution'],"Whether the court should annul the Flemish decree of 22 October 2021, the amendment of ""the Energy Decree of 8 May 2009, which prohibits the installation or replacement of a fuel oil boiler.""",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/belgische-federatie-der-brandstoffenhandelaars-vzw-and-others-and-lamine-v-flemish-government/
Beijing Fengfujiuxin Marketing and Technology Co. Ltd. v Zhongyan Zhichuang Blockchain Co. Ltd.,"In May 2019, Beijing Fengfujiuxin Marketing and Technology Co. Ltd. (the plaintiff) and Zhongyan Zhichuang Blockchain Co. Ltd. (the defendant) signed three contracts that stipulated the plaintiff would purchase 1,542 micro data storage servers for bitcoin mining and transfer 93% of the profits from the mining to the plaintiff as either fiat currency or bitcoin. The plaintiff paid RMB 100 million to purchase the facilities and maintain their operation. The defendant paid 18.3463 BTC but stopped sharing the profits from the mining operation afterward. Therefore, the plaintiff sued and sought damages of 278.1655 BTC or USD 95.5 million (roughly RMB 67 million).

On December 14, 2021, The District Court of Chaoyang in Beijing rejected the plaintiffs claims, as the contractual arrangement is voided. According to Article 52(4) of the Contract Law, a contract is void if it harms public interests. To determine the requirements of public interests, the court turned to several notices and announcements issued by various governmental departments, including the Peoples Bank, Ministry of Public Security, NDRC, and Supreme Peoples Court, on the prevention and resolution of risks of virtual currency trading. The court found that, according to these policy documents, cryptocurrency-related activities consume an immense amount of energy and can create instability in the financial market, therefore going against public interests. As a result, the contractual arrangements between the parties are invalid because they jeopardized public interests. Unsatisfied by this decision, the plaintiff appealed to the Intermediate Peoples Court.

New Weather Institute v. FIFA,"In November 2022, the New Weather Institute (the Complainant) submitted a complaint against FIFA to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the self-regulatory organization of the advertising industry in the UK. The Complainant alleges that FIFAs claims that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was carbon-neutral are wrong and likely to mislead consumers in the UK, therefore breaching multiple provisions of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (the Code), and specifically the provisions on misleading advertising and on environmental claims.

FIFA presented the 2022 Qatar World Cup as fully carbon-neutral in its online presence. It operated a climate pledge mechanism targeting ticket holders, requesting of them to make efforts towards reducing their carbon footprint in their daily life, and informing those taking the pledge that their emissions were offset by FIFA.

In particular, the Complainant alleges that FIFA:

- Firstly, ignored emissions reductions as an essential part of carbon-neutrality; it did not demonstrate that it has done everything it can to reduce its own emissions prior to compensating for the remaining emissions (e.g. when it decided to attribute the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country with little football infrastructure in place).
- Secondly, used unsound methodology for its GHG accounting, breaching the Code by only partially accounting for the life cycle of the stadiums, by sending wrong signals regarding the stadiums impact on the environment, and by not taking into account day shuttle flights advertised by Gulf regional airlines when calculating flight emissions of ticket holders.
- Thirdly, and more broadly, generally claimed that a mega-event like the World Cup can be compensated with offsetting. The carbon credits bought by FIFA fail to meet some of the carbon market standards, as they lack additionality and do not permanently remove carbon. Further, the Code was allegedly breached by FIFA by failing to reach the level of substantiation required for an absolute statement like that of carbon-neutrality.

By claiming carbon-neutrality in this way, FIFA allegedly gave ticket holders the impression that attending the World Cup does not have an impact on the environment.",Pending,['United Kingdom>Advertising Standards Authority (ASA)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']","['United Kingdom>UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing']",Whether FIFA's claims that the 2022 World Cup was carbon-neutral are misleading by giving consumers the impression that attending the event has no impact on the environment and therefore in breach of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/new-weather-institute-v-fifa/
Office of the Inspector General and Others v. Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and Others,"In 2022, the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia and the Office of the Inspector in Environmental Matters filed a joint lawsuit before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca seeking the declaration of non-compliance by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (the Ministry) and the President of their obligations under Law 1931 of 2018. The 2018 climate action law, as it is also known, establishes guidelines for climate action in Colombia. The statutes main goals are to put forth climate change adaptation measures, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce the populations and ecosystems vulnerabilities and promote a just transition towards decarbonization. 

Plaintiffs claim that it has been four (4) years since the climate action law was issued and the government (represented by the Ministry and the President) has failed to comply with articles 15, 18, 19, 26 and 29. Claimants argue that the initial term included in article 35 of the same law was of three (3) years since its sanctioning.

Article 15 orders the Colombian government to establish a regulatory framework to define and determine actions related to short, mid and long-term national determined contributions in the context of the UNFCCC. Article 18 commands the Ministry to issue guidelines regarding the creation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of climate change comprehensive management plans at the regional level. Article 19 instructs the government to establish guidelines directed towards territorial entities and environmental authorities to incorporate climate change response and management in their environmental, land use and financing planning documents. Article 26 directs the Ministry to issue regulations regarding the National Information Service on Climate Change (created by the 2018 climate action law) and to outline the rules and procedures to articulate this to other existing systems. Article 29 enjoins the Ministry to establish a number of GHG annually negotiable quotas and delineate the transactions terms and conditions. 

The Tribunal found that the obligation under article 18 had been fulfilled by the Colombian government through Resolution No. 0849 of 2022. This resolution establishes guidelines to create and implement climate change comprehensive management plans at the regional level in accordance with the 2018 climate action law. 

However, the Tribunal declared that defendants had failed to fully comply with the obligations encompassed in articles 15, 19, 26 and 29 of the 2018 climate action law. Despite some initial efforts to set forth climate action-related activities, the Tribunal found that the Colombian government has to date failed: (i) to regulate goals related to national determined contributions; (ii) to issue a legal document to guide territorial entities and authorities in incorporating climate change in their regulatory and planning instruments; (iii) to regulate the National Information Service on Climate Change (draft legislation is in process); and (iv) to establish GHG quotas (draft legislation is in process). As a result, the Tribunal ordered the Ministry and the President to fully comply with 2018 climate action law obligations and established a new term of six (6) months from the time the decision is final and enforceable. 

The defendants filed an appeal before the Council of State. On April 27 of 2023, the Council of State upheld the Tribunals decision regarding the obligations of the Ministry of Environment to comply with Law 1931 of 2018. The Council of State also found that the office of the President lacked legal standing, so orders are directed only towards the Ministry of Environment, who has six (6) months to comply with the judgment.",decided,['Colombia>Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca'],"['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading', 'Suits against governments>Just transition']","['Colombia>Law 1931 of 2018', 'Colombia>Law 393 of 1997', 'Colombia>Constitution']",Whether the Ministry of Environment and the office of the President failed to comply with their obligations established by Law 1931 of 2018 regarding climate action. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/office-of-the-inspector-general-and-others-v-ministry-of-environment-and-sustainable-development-and-others/
"Notre Affaire a Tous Les Amis de la Terre, and Oxfam France v. BNP Paribas","In October 2022, French environmental NGOs Notre Affaire a Tous, Les Amis de la Terre, and Oxfam France sent a notice of intent to sue BNP Paribas. Considering the answer by BNP Paribas, sent on January 24, 2023, as largely insufficient and unsatisfactory, the NGOs decided to bring suit before the Judicial Court of Paris. The notice of intent to sue - which was the first, and necessary, pre-trial step  and the subsequent summons filed before the Judicial Court of Paris on February 23, 2023 claim that BNP Paribas violated the loi sur le devoir de vigilance of 2017 (Law on the duty of vigilance, incorporated in articles L. 225-102-4 and L. 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code), the articles of the Civil Code on the prejudice ecologique (articles 1246-1252 of the French Civil Code), which refers to any non-negligible impairment of the components or functions of ecosystems or the collective benefits derived by humans from the environment, and BNPs unilateral commitment of will to limit and combat climate change.

The law on the duty of vigilance provides that specific companies (those that employ at least five thousand employees within the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory, or that has at least ten thousand employees in its service and in its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory or abroad) must establish a plan to prevent the violation of human rights and environmental damage that may occur in the course of their business. The plan must include reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and those of the companies it controls (...) as well as from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship, when these activities are related to that relationship. If the plan is not correctly drafted or is inadequate to measure and prevent these risks, the company is liable for the damages that it could have prevented. Anyone with a legitimate interest can also ask for injunctive relief to force the company to comply with the law, a groundbreaking preventative mechanism for French legal proceedings.

The summons sent by Notre Affaire a Tous et al. to BNP Paribas details multiple violations of the law. The violations relate not only to how BNP Paribas plan is drafted but also the lack of clarity concerning the report of information about investments and loans and, last but not least, the shortcomings of the measures that the bank allegedly implements to respect the parameters of the Paris Agreement. First, the plan is not self-sufficient, but it refers to other documents that do not provide for binding commitments. Second, it does not identify with sufficient clarity the climate risks deriving from its activities, both in terms of the fossil fuel projects in which BNP Paribas is directly involved and the companies that it supports through its financing and investments. Third, it is not transparent concerning the disclosure and reporting of information concerning BNP Paribas financing and investment activities, as it is limited only to some sectors and does not include scope 3 emissions. Fourth, the plan does not contain any precise and exhaustive information on the stocks and flows of financing and investments to companies active in the fossil fuel sector. Finally, the plan does not include the commitment to cease all financing and investments that support the expansion of fossil fuels that is necessary to comply with the law on the duty of vigilance. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim that BNP Paribas must immediately terminate any financing to companies which develop new fossil projects and any investment in any company which develops new fossil projects. Concerning its existing investments, BNP Paribas must exercise its voting rights and influence in order to force the invested company to renounce new fossil projects and adopt, detail and publicly implement measures compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C. If this is not possible, BNP Paribas must divest. Moreover, concerning its activities of financing and investment in any GHG emitting activities, it must adopt, publish and effectively implement all measures compatible with a 1.5C trajectory.

Students for Climate Solutions Inc v. Minister of Energy and Resources,"In 2022, Students for Climate Solutions brought a case against the Minister of Energy and Resources. The plaintiff argued that the defendant Minister, in granting petroleum exploration permits under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 (CMA), had failed to adequately consider the effects of the exploration on climate change. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that: (1) climate change was a mandatory relevant consideration for the purposes of New Zealand administrative law; (2) that the failure to consider climate change rendered the decision unreasonable; and (3) that the minister had failed to have proper regard for the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealands founding document.

The Court rejected all three grounds of review. On the first ground, the Court found that the CMA was intended in part to promote the exploitation of natural resources, and that climate considerations were absent from the statutory scheme (which was instead designed to promote fossil fuel mining). Secondly, the Court found that the Ministers decision was not unreasonable. And finally, the Court found that the decision did not violate principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Court accepted that the CMA should be interpreted, as far as possible, consistently with Treaty principles. However, in this case the Court found that the Minister sufficiently considered such principles, and they had been appropriately weighed against other factors  the Minister was not required to engage in any broader policy assessment. The Court also expressed concern that the relevant Maori authorities were not represented in the proceedings.

The Court also made general observations about the significance of climate change in the scrutiny of judicial review applied under New Zealand law. The Court both rejected a submission by the plaintiff that a more intense level of scrutiny was necessary, as well as a submission by the defendant that greater deference should be applied given the complex nature of climate change.

Declic et al. v. The Romanian Government,"On January 31, 2023, the NGO Declic and a number of individuals lodged a case before the Cluj Court of Appeal against the Romanian Government, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, seeking that the court order the authorities to take all necessary measures to reduce GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. They also demand that the Court order the Romanian Government to take adequate measures to increase the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 45% and to increase energy efficiency by 13% by 2030. Further, they requested the court to order the Romanian authorities to implement concrete and coherent climate change mitigation and adaptation plans, including annual carbon budgets, within a maximum of 30 days from the final judgment, in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.

The plaintiffs have asked the court to answer three questions:
1. Whether national authorities are in breach of their legal obligations by applying GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 that are significantly lower than the target agreed at EU level for 2030.
2. Whether, according to objective standards (such as the reasonableness tests applied by the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights), the measures taken by central authorities are sufficient, proportionate and will result in limiting global warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius?
3. Wheter the measures taken by the defendants are compatible with the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Romanian Constitution, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the ECHR (right to a future in accordance with human dignity, right to health and an ecologically balanced environment, right to life and privacy). 

The claimants argue that the defendants have both general and specific legal obligations to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The general obligation stems from a number of sources of law, namely: (i) the Constitution of Romania, which provides that the Romanian government shall ensure a better quality of life for its citizens,  and restore and protect the environment, (ii) the Paris Agreement, and (iii) the European Climate Law. They highlight that the public property does not mean that the government can exploit it with no regard to the  consequences, but rather in the public interest . Natural resources such as soil, water, air, wildlife are part of an enduring heritage, and the government has a statutory duty to preserve them in order to safeguard citizens constitutional rights to a healthy environment, to life, and the like. Specific obligations derive from European and national secondary legislation and soft law instruments (Repower EU and domestic plans) and deal with increasing the share of renewables in the national energy grid and energy efficiency. For instance, in the field of renewable energy, it can be observed that Romania's ambitions are falling (38% for 2020, compared to 30.07% for 2030). Overall, the claimants conclude that the Romanian government has taken meager measure, and is therefore failing to meet its legal obligations.

Dieselgate Italian Class Action,"An Italian NGO (Altroconsumo) brought an action against Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A (""VWAG"" and ""VWGI"", together the ""VW group"") seeking a declaration that they engaged in an unfair commercial practice by disseminating untrue information concerning the emissions of Volkswagen-branded EA 89 diesel vehicles, overstating their green features, which was capable of misleading consumers as to the car's characteristics in relation to the emissions standard, and requesting that the defendants be ordered to pay damages. The vehicles had lower quality characteristics and pollutant emission classes than the declared values as a result of the installation of software called ""defeat device"". The defendants claimed that they had never provided information on the emissions level in their advertising communications. 

Altroconsumo argued that the VW group's ""green claims"" were false and deceptive, and constituted a misleading commercial practice prohibited by the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive no. 2005/29/CE (implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 145/2007). The plaintiffs also argued that Volkswagen had violated their right to freedom of contract and that the plaintiffs had suffered financial loss, equal to the decrease in value of the vehicle because it did not possess the promised green qualities. Over 63,000 individuals who had bought Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda vehicles in the relevant period joined the class action, all claiming to have been damaged by the same conduct.

The Court found that the defendants were responsible for using misleading, and at times false, ""green claims"" in their marketing and advertising activities. The Court awarded damages under tort law, amounting to 3,000 Euros for each member of the class action for financial damage, 300 Euros each for moral damage, and legal expenses, amounting to over 200 million Euros in total.

According to the Court, the VW group's conduct potentially misled consumers. Such potential effect was enough to draw a causal link between Volkswagen's behaviour and the damage suffered by the consumers, as it was presumed  in the absence of evidence to the contrary  that consumers were influenced in their commercial choices by the VW group's ""green claims"". To reach its conclusions, the Court relied on reasoning expressed by the Italian Supreme Court in prospectus liability cases where a similar presumption applies.

Children of Austria v. Austria,"On 21 February 2023, a group of Austrian children filed a complaint with the Austrian Constitutional Court. The applicants alleged that the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz 2011) is, in part, unconstitutional for violating the constitutionally guaranteed rights of children and the fundamental right to equality before the law. The Austrian Constitutional Court rejected the application as inadmissible by decision of 27 June 2023. According to the Court, the scope of the application was too narrow, and repealing the contested provisions would not have eliminated the underlying unconstitutionality. Relying on its earlier case law, the court, therefore, considered the application as inadmissible. Further, the court held that repealing the contested phrases would have given the contested provision of the Federal Climate Protection Act a different content. Repeal would thus amount to an act of legislation by the court, which is prohibited due to the separation of powers principle. 

Background
The Federal Climate Protection Act was adopted in 2011 to implement emission reduction obligations under European law. The Annexes to the Act set out the maximum levels of greenhouse gas emissions by sector for 2008-2012 and 2013-2020. However, the Act does not stipulate any emissions reduction targets after 2020. The lack of binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets leads to persistently high emission levels on Austrian territory. In light of this, the applicants alleged the unconstitutionality of Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act for (a) establishing commitment periods that only extend to 2020, (b) stipulating a pure negotiation obligation regarding the development of effective GHG reduction targets (instead of a mandate to take action) and (c) providing retrospective (instead of preventive) emergency measures in case of an exceedance of GHG ceilings established under international or EU law. In concrete terms, the applicants brought forward that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act violated childrens rights and their right to equality before the law. In eventu, the applicants further demanded the repeal of parts of Art 3 para 1 of the Federal Climate Protection Act. 

Rights of Children 
The Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children implements the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the national level; it grants subjective rights (constitutionally guaranteed rights) to children, i.e., persons under the age of 18 years. Under Art 1, every child has the right to have his or her best interests protected. This includes protection and care, the best possible development and the safeguarding of child interests; in addition, Art 1 requires consideration of intergenerational equity. This commitment to intergenerational equity can also be found in the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability, Animal Protection, Comprehensive Environmental Protection, Water and Food Security as well as Research. This state objective that does not grant subjective rights but shall guide the interpretation of other legal sources. 
The plaintiffs alleged that climate change triggers positive obligations under Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children as it poses an imminent danger to the well-being of present and future generations. Thus, Austria is obligated to take adequate measures to protect child well-being against the disastrous impacts of climate change and restrictions of freedom related to drastic emission reduction measures needed in the future. Such need for drastic emission reduction is evident as  according to the plaintiffs  the scope of state obligations under Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children is to be interpreted through the latest scientific findings as well as EU and international legal requirements. These sources allow calculating of a national CO2 budget based on the internationally agreed 1.5C target. Said CO2 budget, in turn, constitutes a finite resource in the sense of the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability. Thus, it is to be managed sustainably, and its consumption should respect the interests of future generations. 
In a nutshell, the applicants argued that constitutional law requires (a) the non-exceedance of the national CO2 budget and (b) equitable distribution of the remaining budget between generations in order to prevent a violation of the plaintiffs constitutionally guaranteed rights to (child) well-being. The plaintiffs asserted that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act does not meet these requirements and therefore violates Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children, which is to be interpreted in light of the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability. 
The applicants reached a similar conclusion based on the Charta of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR). According to Art 51 CFR, the Chartas scope is principally opened as adopting the Federal Climate Protection Act constitutes an implementation of GHG reduction targets determined under EU law. Art 24 CFR stipulates that children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being. Under EU law, children thus have a right to protection of their well-being, similar to the national right. The European rights of the child under Art 24 CFR are to be interpreted in light of Art 37 CFR, which, in turn, refers to the principle of sustainable development. In a manner comparable to the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability, Art 37 CFR imposes an obligation to manage resources in an equitable and fundamental rights-respecting manner. This includes Austrias remaining CO2 budget, which is to be distributed equitably between generations to protect the rights of the child under Art 24 CFR.

Right to Equality before the Law 
The application also relied on the right to equality before the law for asserting the unconstitutionality of Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act. This fundamental right entails a principle of fair burden sharing; in particular, it prohibits the realisation of the welfare of all (or the majority) at the expense of the few. The applicants alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act violated the right to equality before the law for two reasons. First, the provision infringes the general principle of objectivity (allgemeines Sachlichkeitsgebot), inherent to the right to equality before the law. Second, they alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act entails unequal treatment of children compared to adults, which cannot be justified. 
The general principle of objectivity requires that legal norms serve the public interest and seek to realise it with appropriate, necessary and proportionate means. If this is not the case, the legal norm is not objective and thus unconstitutional. According to the applicants, the Federal Climate Protection Act must thus meet two requirements: First, individual norms must be suitable (appropriate) to achieve the Acts general objective, enabling the coordinated implementation of effective climate protection measures and ensure a rapid reduction of GHG emissions. Second, burdens associated with reducing GHG emissions must be distributed evenly between members of society. The Federal Climate Protection Act does not meet these requirements: Art 3 para 2 of the Act violates the principle of fair burden sharing as the lack of binding reduction pathways causes a rapid consumption of the remaining CO2 budget, which could be used up entirely already in 2025. Consequently, the GHG reduction burden is transferred to younger generations and not equitably distributed between all members of society. In addition, the applicants noted that it is impossible to achieve the Acts objective (to comply with international and EU mitigation obligations) without legally binding GHG reduction pathway. Art 3 of the Federal Climate Protection Act hinders the adoption of a legally binding pathway in providing a pure negotiation obligation paired with references to past commitment periods only. Overall, Art 3 thus undermines the objective of the Federal Climate Protection Act.  
The applicants further alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act provides for unequal treatment of children compared to adults. This is because the current formulation and design of the Federal Climate Protection Act (especially the lack of legally binding reduction pathways) allow for rapid consumption of the remaining CO2 budget (probably until 2025). Consequently, the burdens associated with emission reduction are largely transferred to the future and, thus, to younger generations. Younger generations are treated unequally compared to older generations as they bear the brunt of restrictions of freedom associated with emission reduction, especially as restrictions of freedom will be more severe the more time passes without action. According to the plaintiffs, such unequal treatment is not justified and thus violates their right to equality before the law.

"ADI 7332 (Policy for ""just energy transition"" of the State of Santa Catarina)","On December 29, 2022, the political party Rede Sustentabilidade (Rede) filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI), with a request for injunctive relief, against the State Law 18,330/2022, which institutes the Policy for Just Energy Transition of the State of Santa Catarina. The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educacao e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. Rede's action questions the constitutionality of State Law 18,330/2022, which refers to electricity generation and the need for a just energy transition in the state of Santa Catarina. However, the State Law allows the use of non-renewable sources through coal-fired thermoelectric plants, arguing that these are fundamental for maintaining energy security. The plaintiff argues that, in reality, the law is nothing more than a ""legislative facade"" to perpetuate the role of coal in the state's energy system. The law does not present guidelines for the reduction of greenhouse gases (GHGs) or even the abatement of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from activities related to the coal production chain. There is also no deadline for abandoning the use of coal; on the contrary, it foresees the installation of new industrial complexes that will use this fossil fuel. Finally, the law establishes tax and credit incentives for the coal production chain, also without any time limit. The plaintiff argues that these incentives make it possible to indirectly fund the purchase of electricity derived from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the State Policy for Just Energy Transition, in fact, serves to foster the use of coal and, consequently, an increase in GHG emissions, the plaintiff claims it violates the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement, as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). The petition mentions several international organizations and their agendas which plan to eliminate the use of fossil fuels - especially coal - to show that the policy is a setback compared to the rest of the world and contradictory to the concept of a just transition. The plaintiff points out that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, the worsening of climate change, and damage to the public health, especially for populations already suffering from socio-economic disadvantages. It also challenges the provision in article 42 of the Law that excludes liability for environmental damage in the case of use of resources from duly licensed activities. Finally, it argues that the membership of the Council responsible for implementing the policy violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is an unequal number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors involved in environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines. 

The plaintiff alleges several formal defects in the legislative process and material violations of numerous provisions of the Federal Constitution, including (i) article 1, which provides for participatory democracy; (ii) article 5, clause 1, providing for the principle of equality; (iii) article 6, establishing social rights; (iv) article 170, clauses 5 and 6, establishing the principles of consumer protection and sustainable development in the economic order; (v) article 196, which provides for the fundamental right to health; and (vi) article 225, which provides for the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment. Thus, the plaintiff calls for, as a precautionary measure, the suspension of the effects of several articles of State Law 18,330/2022, considered unconstitutional, as well as, by extension, all of its provisions. As a final measure, the plaintiff requests the confirmation of the injunction, with the granting of the action, for the declaration of unconstitutionality of several articles of the Law and, consequently, all of its provisions.

Request for an advisory opinion on the obligations of States with respect to climate change,"On March 29, 2023, the 77th session of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) adopted the resolution A/77/L.58, requesting an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on the obligations of States with respect to climate change. The resolution was adopted by consensus. This initiative was largely led by the Government of Vanuatu, which worked with other countries to prepare a draft resolution through internal negotiations and several rounds of informal consultations with the wider UN membership.

The request for an advisory opinion acknowledges that climate change is an unprecedented challenge of civilizational proportions and that the well-being of present and future generations of humankind depends on our immediate and urgent response to it. The UNGA resolution also takes note of the scientific consensus expressed, inter alia, in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In particular, the UNGA underscores that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are the dominant cause of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century and that human-induced climate change has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.

In this context, the UNGA recalls the importance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement as expressions of the determination to address decisively the threat posed by climate change. The resolution also underscores the importance of implementing these treaties, particularly in light of the significant gap between States current nationally determined contributions and the emission reductions required to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5C, as well as the gap between current levels of adaptation and the levels needed to respond to the adverse effects of climate change.

Therefore, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, the UNGA requests the ICJ to render an advisory opinion on the following questions:

Having particular regard to the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the duty of due diligence, the rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principle of prevention of significant harm to the environment and the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment,

(a) What are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations;

(b) What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to:

(i) States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change?

(ii) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change?

Shailendra Prasad Ambedkar v. Office of Prime Minister et. al.,"Pursuant to Article 119 of the Constitution, the Minister for Finance of the Government of Nepal shall lay before the joint sitting of both Houses of the Federal Parliament an annual estimate setting out, inter alia, an estimate of national revenue and the money required to meet the charges on the Federal Consolidated Fund. Following the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown however, Budget Draft for the fiscal year 2021/22 was passed through an Ordinance. The petitioners in this case argued that adoption of the national budget through Ordinance was largely unconstitutional and more minutely, took contention with point no. 199 of the Draft which held that stone, gravel, and sand was to be exported to reduce the countrys trade deficit following an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report. 

The petitioners claimed that excavation of stone, gravel, and sand would reduce the fertile plains of the Terai and Madhesh to barren land. The major geomorphic process in Churia coupled with weak geology, heavy rainfall and tropical weathering also means that region already experiences rapid fluvial erosion. Consequently, if excavation were to go ahead, entire villages would face increased vulnerability to floods and agricultural practices indigenous to the Terai region would be lost. The petitioners argued therefore, that allowing excavation along the Chure Range would be a flagrant violation of Article 30 of the Constitution which stipulates that every citizen has the right to a clean and healthy environment. The petitioners specifically made their claim based on Chures increased vulnerability to climate change.

The Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court, in this case, sided with the petitioners and held that excavation of stone, gravel and sand would be tantamount to ecocide and against the norm of environmental justice and inter-generational equity. The Court also acknowledged that although the State exercises permanent sovereignty over natural resources as a constituent right of self-determination, precedent set by the Court prompts that the precautionary principle be applied. The Court iterates that environmental complexity is increasing in Nepal due to climate change and urges the government to be mindful towards the life of and within the Chure and not view it solely from an economic lens. The Court also referenced that as party to several international environmental treaties, the State has a positive obligation to preserve wetlands, protect biodiversity, and curb the illegal trade of endangered species. It also referenced the UN Human Rights Council resolution 48/13 acknowledging the right to a healthy environment as a fundamental human right. In keeping with this, an interim order from the Court stopped the draft budget from going through and the Court also halted the planned excavation of the Chure range with an order of Certiorari.

"Association ""Za Zemiata (For the Earth) - Access to Justice"" and ""The Green Tank, Hellenic Republic v. Executive Director of the Environment Executive Agency, TPP ""Maritsa-Iztok 2"" EAD","This case first began in 2019 after the thermal power plant (TPP) Maritsa-Iztok 2 got its integrated permit for operation renewed indefinitely, allowing the plant to release mercury and sulphur oxides above set emissions limits. The Court of First Instance (Administrative Court Stara Zagora) dismissed the case, stating that there is no violation of the Aarhus Convention, even though the operations of the TPP in question have a transboundary effect. The Court also did not find any violations of the national Code of Administrative Procedure or the European Directives on ambient air quality and industrial emissions.

The Applicants appealed the judgment before the Administrative Court of Cassation (ACC). The ACC requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The ACC found that there is discrepancy between the update of the plan for the management of ambient air quality in the municipality of Galabovo, developed for the pollutants: particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) for 2019-2023 and the appealed decision of the Executive Director of the Environment Executive Agency. Namely, the reduced desulphurisation rates authorized by the Executive Director in the decision at issue are not consistent with the minimum desulphurisation rate of 98%. Furthermore, the authorized daily and hourly average rates of SO2 are systematically exceeded, which led, inter alia, to the adoption and update of the plan referred to above and gave rise to the bringing of an action for failure to fulfill obligations in Case C730/19, Commission v. Bulgaria. The ACC asked the CJEU three questions relating to the obligations of the competent authorities when considering a request for a derogation from the set emission limit values when reissuing integrated permits.

On March 9, 2023, the CJEU gave its judgment on the preliminary ruling. The CJEU found that a derogation from the set emission limit values may be granted only if less strict emission limit values do not cause 'significant pollution' and, in spite of that derogation, a 'high level of protection of the environment as a whole' could be achieved. Moreover, the pollution in excess of the air quality limit values for SO2 in the area of the TPP in question cannot be regarded as insignificant pollution, but could objectively be described as 'significant pollution'. Thus, a derogation from the set emission limit values could not be granted, if it is such as to contribute to exceeding air quality limit values set by Directive 2008/50 for SO2. Additionally, the competent authority empowered to grant such a derogation must also refrain from setting less strict emission limit values for pollutants originating from an installation where such a derogation would be contrary to the measures established in the air quality plan adopted in the zone concerned. 

This judgment comes in a moment when there is talk in Bulgaria of renegotiating the Recovery Plan, which originally envisioned a 40% reduction in thermal power plant emissions and the introduction of more energy from renewable sources. Even though the judgment considers sulfur emissions, its principles could be very well be applied to other pollutants that originate from thermal power plants like Maritsa-Iztok 2.

After the CJEU judgment on the preliminary ruling, the case returned to the Bulgarian ACC, which must decide the case on its merits.",Pending,"['Bulgaria>Administrative Court of Cassation', 'European Union>European Court of Justice']","['Suits against governments>Energy and power', 'Suits against governments>Trade and Investment>Environmental permitting']","['Bulgaria>Law on environmental protection', 'Bulgaria>Law on clean ambient air']",Whether a thermal power plant's renewed integrated permit that allows it to exceed set emissions limits violates Bulgarian and/or EU law. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/association-za-zemiata-for-the-earth-access-to-justice-and-the-green-tank-hellenic-republic-v-executive-director-of-the-environment-executive-agency-tpp-maritsa-iztok-2-ead/
Comissao Pastoral da Terra and Notre Affaire a Tous v. BNP Paribas,"On October 11, 2022, NGOs Comissao Pastoral da Terra and Notre Affaire a Tous sent a notice of intent to sue BNP Paribas in relation to its financing of businesses allegedly responsible for the deforestation of Amazon and violations of human rights. Considering the answer by BNP Paribas as largely insufficient and non-satisfactory, the NGOs have decided to bring suit before the Judicial Court of Paris.

The notice of intent to sue - which was the first, and necessary, pre-trial stage  and the following summons filed before the Judicial Court of Paris, claim BNP Paribas violated the loi sur le devoir de vigilance of 2017 (Law on the duty of vigilance; incorporated in articles L. 225-102-4 and 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code).

The law on the duty of vigilance provides that specific companies (those who employ at least five thousand employees within the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory, or that has at least ten thousand employees in its service and in its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory or abroad) must establish a plan to prevent the violation of human rights and environmental damage that may occur in the course of their business. The plan must include reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and those of the companies it controls (...) as well as from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship, when these activities are related to that relationship. If the plan is not correctly drafted or is inadequate to measure and prevent these risks, the company is liable for the damages that it might have prevented. Anyone with a legitimate interest can also ask for injunctive relief to force the company to comply with the law, a groundbreaking preventative mechanism for French legal proceedings.

The summons sent by Comissao Pastoral da Terra and Notre Affaire a Tous to BNP Paribas details multiple violations of the law, stating that the banks vigilance plan is not adequate to prevent the violations of human rights.

In particular, BNP Paribas provides financial services without adequate due diligence to corporations, such as Marfrig, one of the worlds largest producers of beef. Suppliers to Marfrig have allegedly engaged in severe deforestation of the Amazon, land-grabbing of protected indigenous territories, and forced labor in cattle farms. 

The beef sector is the largest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, and it is also among the largest sources of methane emissions.

The violations relate not only to how BNP Paribas plan is drafted but also the lack of clarity concerning int environmental commitments and the fact that the plan identifies as a risk only deforestation, and not also the seizure of indigenous peoples land, forced labor, and methane emissions. Moreover, the plan does contain adequate measures to mitigate the abovementioned risks of human rights violations. 

Therefore, the plaintiffs claim that the Court has to order BNP Paribas to fulfill its obligation relating to the duty of vigilance and, therefore, to implement a new plan. 

In this plan, BNP Paribas should: 
- group together all the elements relating to the law on the duty of vigilance within its plan;
- put an end to the ambiguity of its environmental commitments within its vigilance plan and in its public communication, which contributes to greenwashing;
- identify the risks of invasion of indigenous territories, slavery-like practices, and methane emissions, particularly from cattle farming and in Brazil, and adopt appropriate risk mitigation and prevention measures accordingly;
- measures to assess the situation of suppliers and take appropriate risk mitigation and prevention actions to ensure that its customers supply chains do not contribute to deforestation, use slavery-like practices, or infringe on the rights of indigenous peoples;
- establish an easily accessible alert and reporting mechanism for third parties who are or may be affected by negative impacts caused by the Group's activities and customers.
- establish a specific system for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness.",pending,['France>Judicial Court of Paris'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Financing and investment']","['France>French Commercial Code>Article L. 225-102-4', 'France>French Commercial Code>Article L. 225-102-5', 'France>Duty of Vigilance Law']",Whether BNP Paribas plan is adequate to prevent the violation of human rights and the deforestation.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/comissa%cc%83o-pastoral-da-terra-and-notre-affaire-a-tous-v-bnp-paribas/
"Eurowind OU vs. Tori parish, Land Board and Environmental Board","In 2017, two wind energy developers Eurowind OU and Nelja Energia AS submitted an application to Sauga parish (now Tori parish) for the approval of design provisions for constructing a wind park. According to the area planning, the area under question is a peat deposit that is also suitable for wind park construction. At the time of the application, three companies held permits for extracting peat. Sauga parish denied approval of design provisions, because peat extraction was supposed to continue for decades and in the view of the parish, the wind park could only be constructed after the peat deposit is exhausted. Eurowind OU filed a complaint to the Tallinn Administrative Court, which rejected it as well as the District Court. 

The Supreme Court accepted the complaint and ruled that if an area has been dedicated to wind energy development by an area planning, then the administrative body (parish, Land Board or Environmental Board) must do everything reasonable to implement this when deciding upon the approval of design provisions. The Court also considered both the extraction of peat from deposits already in use and the construction of wind turbines to increase wind energy production to be in significant public interest. 

In the Courts view, an option whereby wind energy can be produced and peat extracted simultaneously could possibly best satisfy both public interests. Both the parish and the state are obliged to actively assist finding the best solution. Although the developers and the peat extractors have the greatest responsibility in finding a suitable solution, if an agreement is not reached, administrative bodies must take action to balance the different public interests, including amending the peat extraction permits to allow the construction of the wind park.

Mihkel Undrest vs. Government of Estonia,"In 2022, the Government of Estonia imposed a thematic maritime planning which broadly determines areas suitable for the development of wind parks and lays down the general principles and parameters for wind parks in those areas. Mihkel Undrest, a resident whose land on the coast is about 11 kilometres from where the closest wind turbines could be constructed, filed a complaint to the Tallinn Administrative Court and requested the annulment of the planning insofar as it restricts his right to enjoy his home and the right to property.

The Tallinn Administrative Court returned the complaint to the plaintiff owing to a lack of locus standi. The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Tallinn Circuit Court which rejected the appeal. 

The Supreme Court of Estonia considered the appeal and rejected it, but amended the arguments of the courts of lower instances. The Supreme Court ruled that a very broad planning such as the one in question can interfere with a persons rights and therefore give locus standi, but the Court did not detect a breach of rights in this case. The Court also stated that for a person to claim that wind turbines breach their rights, the wind turbines must be in their immediate vicinity and that a distance of more than 10 kilometres does not amount to it.

KlimaAllianz v. FIFA,"In a concerted action with similar actions filed in the UK, France, Belgium and the Netherlands, Klima-Allianz, a Swiss-based coalition of 140 civil society organisations, filed a claim against FIFA claiming that FIFAs advertising of the 2022 Football World Cup in Qatar as carbon neutral was misleading athletes, football fans and the 5 billion people expected to follow the event (which was held from November 20, 2022 until December 18, 2022 as the first winter world cup ever).

In June 2023, the Fair Advertising Commission upheld all five complaints (which were joined into one proceeding). After thorough review of the subject matter, the Commission recommended that FIFA refrain from making unsubstantiated claims in the future, particularly the claim that the 2022 FIFA World Cup in Qatar was climate or carbon-neutral. In substance, the Commission reiterated that strict standards apply when advertising carbon neutrality and that factual claims must be accurate and not misleading, which extends to environmental claims.

Movement v. Waka Kotahi,"The respondent, Waka Kotahi, is New Zealands national transport agency. The petitioner challenged a decision by Waka Kotahi to approve a National Land Transport Programme 2021-2024 (NLTP), a three-year plan which sets out how the agency will allocate its resources. Movement argued that the approval of the plan was unlawfully inconsistent with New Zealand legislation (the Land Transport Management Act 2003 (LTMA)), as well as New Zealands Government Policy Statement on land transport, another regulatory instrument which is legally binding on Waka Kotahi. Movement consequently sought directions from the Court for the NLTP to be reconsidered, as well as guidance to inform the preparation of future NLTPs. The Court rejected all three of the applicants causes of action discussed below, and upheld the NLTP.

In the first action, Movement argued that Waka Kotahi was required to ensure that the NLTP contributed to the purposes of the LTMA, and gave effect to the GPS. Movement argued that this included an obligation to ensure that the NLTP would reduce emissions; and that the NLTP approved by Waka Kotahi failed to do so. In particular, Movement argued that this failure violated the purpose of the LTMA, which was to contribute to an effective, efficient, and safe land transport system in the public interest; and further, that it violated directives in the GPS to plan for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions ... through action across all priorities, programmes and activity classes. The Court rejected the claim that the LTMAs purpose implied an obligation to consider environmental benefits or climate change, relying in large part on recent amendments to the statute. The Court also found that the NLTP complied with the GPS directives to support emissions reductions. The first cause of action was consequently rejected.

Secondly, Movement argued that Waka Kotahis decision-making was procedurally deficient. Specifically, Movement argued that the priority-setting methods used in the preparation of the NLTP failed to assess whether the overall effect of the NLTPs investment decisions would achieve the emissions reduction target recommended by New Zealands Climate Change Commission (CCC). Movement argued that this was inconsistent with the GPS, which requires real-term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, Movement argued that Waka Kotahi was required to make a quantitative assessment to determine the baseline quantum and trajectory of transport emissions; understand how different components of the land transport system would contribute to the reduction of emissions contemplated by CCC; make an ambitious assessment as to which reductions are required under the NLTP; assess the carbon emissions of activities in the 2021-2024 period; and ultimately, ensure that the NLTPs contribution to emissions reductions was consistent with the magnitude of emissions reductions contemplated by the CCC. The Court found, however, that Waka Kotahi was not required under the LTMA or GPS to undertake either a baseline or predictive quantitative assessment of emissions. Instead, it cited precedent that courts have cautioned against requiring decision-makers to carry out a quantitative analysis in the absence of express directions to do so, and that Waka Kotahi had satisfied its legal obligations by undertaking qualitative assessments as to how the NLTP would give effect to the GPS It was not required to ensure that all or any investment decisions supported a mathematical reduction in emissions, but rather it was required to consider the programme as a whole and balance the strategic priorities. In this case, Waka Kotahi had relied on experts and sufficiently addressed climate change as a strategic priority.

Thirdly, Movement argued that Waka Kotahi had committed an error of law by failing to show that it had considered alternative courses of action that would meet the objectives set out in the GPS. This was because Waka Kotahi was a funding applicant for the purposes of the GPS, and was accordingly required to show that they have considered alternatives and how they compare in achieving various objectives identified in the GPS. The Court found that this obligation applied only in funding applications made by Waka Kotahi, and not in the preparation of a NLTP.",decided,['New Zealand>High Court of New Zealand'],"['Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting', 'Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading']",['New Zealand>Land Transport Management Act 2003'],"Whether, in its preparation of a National Land Transport Programme (NLTP), New Zealands national land transport agency had lawfully complied with its procedural obligations under national legislation and high-level policy, including an alleged obligation to put in place quantitative measures for emissions.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/movement-v-waka-kotahi/
Greenpeace Canada v. Pathways Alliance,"Greenpeace Canada submitted a complaint to the Competition Bureau of Canada in March 2023 alleging that the Pathways Alliances Lets clear the air advertising campaign makes false and/or misleading representations to the public.

Formed in 2021, the Pathways Alliance (Pathways) is a coalition of six of Canadas largest oil sands producers: Canadian Natural Resources Limited, Cenovus Energy, ConocoPhillips Canada, Imperial, MEG Energy, and Suncor Energy. Collectively, these six companies produce 95% of Canadas oil sands production and are responsible for 63% of Canadas total daily oil production.

Greenpeace Canada alleges that Pathways claim that they are actively reducing emissions and helping Canada achieve its climate targets are false and misleading for the following four reasons: (1) Pathways net zero plan fails to incorporate the lifecycle of their produce and does not account for more than 80% of their emissions meaning that their own calculations do not result in them achieving net zero; (2) Pathways members claim to be making strides toward net zero but at the same time are expanding their fossil fuel production; (3) Pathways has indicated that the only issues facing their carbon capture and sequestration project are related to financing and regulatory approval but the technologies themselves are speculative; and (4) the representations give the impression that Pathways is a climate leader, but individually and through industry affiliation, Pathways members have advocated, advertised, and/or spoken against climate action in Canada.

Greenpeace Canada has asked the Competition Bureau to have Pathways: (1) remove all the representations about reducing emissions, achieving net zero, cleaning air, and combatting climate change; (2) issue a public retraction of these statement; and (3) pay a fine that is the greater of $10 million or 3% of worldwide gross revenues to organizations for the rehabilitation and clean-up of oil sands production.

Eolise v. France,"Assessing that France was not following a trajectory that would enable it to meet its climate objectives, on October 5, 2022, Eolise submitted to the French Government ten legislative and regulatory proposals concerning renewable energies.

The Government has refused to consider this proposal (this lack of answer is administratively considered an implicit refusal).

Eolise considers that the so-called renewable energy acceleration law, that has been subsequently approved, will not allow the development of renewable energies in France and the achievement of the planned objectives.

Eolise considers that the law does not address the concrete and indispensable measures to implement the objective to accelerate the transition to renewable energies law and has decided to sue the French government, asking the Council of State to annul the implicit refusal to consider its ten propositions. 

Plaintiff asks the Council of State to order the French State to take all useful measures in favor of the development of renewable energies to achieve the binding objectives set by the applicable laws and Treaties and, even more, to accelerate the development of these energies in the public interest, within a maximum period of six months.

"ClientEarth, Surfrider Foundation Europe, and Zero Waste France v. Danone","In September 2022, NGOs ClientEarth, Surfrider Foundation Europe, and Zero Waste France sent a notice of intent to sue to Danone, where they claimed that the company does not adequately address the risks related to the plastic pollution it produces. Considering the answer by Danone, as insufficient and non-satisfactory, the NGOs have decided to bring suit before the Judicial Court of Paris.

The notice of intent to sue - which was the first, and necessary, pre-trial stage  and the following summons filed before the Judicial Court of Paris, claim Danone violated the loi sur le devoir de vigilance of 2017 (Law on the duty of vigilance; incorporated in articles L. 225-102-4 and 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code).

The law on the duty of vigilance provides that specific companies (those who employ at least five thousand employees within the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory, or that has at least ten thousand employees in its service and in its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory or abroad) must establish a plan to prevent the violation of human rights and environmental damage that may occur in the course of their business. The plan must include reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and those of the companies it controls (...) as well as from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship, when these activities are related to that relationship. If the plan is not correctly drafted or is inadequate to measure and prevent these risks, the company is liable for the damages that it might have prevented. Anyone with a legitimate interest can also ask for injunctive relief to force the company to comply with the law, a groundbreaking preventative mechanism for French legal proceedings.

NGOs claim that the company, that is amongst the top 10 biggest plastic polluters worldwide, uses far too much plastic and has never adopted adequate measures to address the harm related to its use of plastics. Plastics are present throughout its supply chain, with a huge amount used to package its products, including water bottles and yoghurt pots.

The NGOs claim an injunction to force the company to: 
1.	Map the impacts its use of plastics has on the environment, climate, health and human rights from production to end-of-life. 
2.	Provide a complete assessment of its plastic footprint, including plastics used in producing the products it sells, plastics used in logistics and promotions and plastic packaging.
3.	On the basis of this assessment, put together a deplastification plan with quantified and dated objectives and act on it.

Possible v. Secretary of State for Transport; and GALBA v. SST (challenges to governments Jet Zero strategy for decarbonising aviation),"In October 2022, climate charity Possible as well as Group for Action on Leeds Bradford Airport (GALBA) filed separate claims for judicial review in the High Court for England and Wales against the Secretary of State for Transport (SoS Transport), challenging the UK governments Jet Zero strategy. The Jet Zero strategy is the UKs strategy to decarbonise the aviation sector to achieve net zero in aviation by 2050.

The strategy is alleged to:
-	breach the UKs Climate Change Act 2008 since the SoS Transport did not ensure that it would enable the UKs carbon budgets to be met, which would result in a failure to deliver net zero
-	breach public law principles, because the SoS Transport a) departed from advice given by the Climate Change Committee (the UKs statutory advisory body on climate change) on reducing demand without giving lawful reasons, b) did not lawfully consult on the strategy, c) failed to take into account emissions other than CO2 caused by flights.

GALBA makes an additional argument on the effects of the strategy on local planning applications for airports.

CAN (Coal Action Network) v. Coal Authority and Welsh Ministers,"In 2020, private company Energybuild Ltd applied to the UK Coal Authority for a coal mine extension licence in Aberpergwm, Wales. Emissions relating to the extension are estimated to be around 100 million tonnes of CO2 from combustion of the coal and 1.17 million tonnes of methane gas, until the license expires in 2039. 

In response, in 2021 Coal Action Network, a group that aims to end coal use within the UK, started a campaign, calling on Welsh and UK ministers to intervene against the Coal Authority and stop the coal mine expansion. Yet ministers of the Welsh and the UK-wide governments were in disagreement over who had the jurisdiction to make the decision to stop the coal mine extension. 

In January 2022 the Coal Authority approved the license, resulting in a public law challenge by Coal Action Network. In July 2022 that challenge was given permission to proceed to a full hearing. 

The grounds allege: 
1.	Welsh ministers had the statutory power to refuse to approve the authorisation.
2.	The Coal Authority interpreted its own statutory powers too narrowly. It had broad discretion to consider any relevant matters when making licensing decisions, and it did have discretion to refuse to approve this authorisation.

"Friends of the Earth v. Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities; and South Lakeland Action on Climate Change v. SSLUHC (Whitehaven coalmine)","In January 2023, the two environmental organisations Friends of the Earth (FoE) and South Lakeland Action On Climate Change (SLACC) filed public law challenges to the UK Governments decision to grant planning permission for a new coking coal mine in the UK.

The decision to grant planning permission was made in December 2022 by the Secretary of State (SoS) for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, on the recommendation of a planning inspector after a planning inquiry held in 2021.

FoE challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:
-	The SoS conclusion that the mine would be a net-zero mine for the purpose of reaching the UKs Sixth Carbon Budget (covering the period of 2033-37, and as established under the UKs Climate Change Act 2008) was unlawful. International carbon offset credits, which the mining company undertook to buy to offset the mines residual emissions, do not count towards the UKs carbon budgets.
-	The SoS failed to lawfully address the international impact of this decision, despite the evidence given on this issue by highly qualified people, like the former chair of the IPCC.
-	The SoS erred in his approach to the extent to which the coal would substitute for other coal in the global market or be additional to it, resulting in the unlawful conclusion that there would be no net emissions increase because of the mine. 
-	FoE also reserved the right to argue a point on the SoS approach to downstream emissions, depending on the UK Supreme Courts decision in R (Finch) v Surrey County Council & ors, to be heard in June 2023. 

SLACC challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:
-	The SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of whether or not there would be perfect substitution, which would determine the extent of the climate impact of the mine.
-	The SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of the international impact of granting planning consent.
-	The SoS incorrectly determined whether downstream emissions are indirect significant environmental effects of the mine.
-	The SoS applied a different threshold to the opposing parties evidence and arguments at the planning inquiry, and imposed the unlawful burden on the claimant of disproving the mine companys case.

"Rights: Community: Action v. Secretary of State for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities (Action Plan for Salt Cross Garden Village)","In April 2023, rights and climate collective Rights: Community: Action (RCA) issued a legal challenge to a decision by two of the governments planning inspectors. The planning inspectors had reviewed the West Oxfordshire District Councils Area Action Plan (AAP) for a planned new garden village in Salt Cross and decided that the village does not need to be built to the net zero standards suggested by the Council. 

The inspectors questioned whether the policies in the AAP relating to net zero carbon development, zero waste, green infrastructure, and protecting and enhancing environmental assets were justified, effective, and consistent with national and local policy. They said the standards demanded by the AAP are significantly higher than those required in the 2013 Building Regulations and conflict with national policy on energy efficiency contained in a 2015 Written Ministerial Statement (WMS).

The policies set out in the AAP include that the village should be fossil fuel free, and able to supply 100% of the energy needed from on-site renewable energy sources.

RCA argues that:
-	The WMS is out of date and has been overtaken by law and policy since 2015; 
-	The inspectors misinterpreted the WMS, and neither the WMS nor national policy conflict with the AAP;
-	The zero carbon homes policy was abandoned against whats written in the WMS;
-	The inspectors misinterpretation also affected the approach to the question of whether there was a sound evidence base to justify the zero carbon homes policy.",pending,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>GHG emissions reduction and trading>Other'],['United Kingdom>Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004'],Whether planning inspectors acted unlawfully when finding a councils inclusion of net-zero standards in its plan for the development of a new village conflicted with national policy.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rights-community-action-v-secretary-of-state-for-levelling-up-housing-and-communities-action-plan-for-salt-cross-garden-village/
Josefina Huffington Archbold v. Office of the President and others,"On November 16, 2020, citizen Josefina Huffington Archbold filed a tutela against the office of the President, the National Unit for Risk Management, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Housing seeking the constitutional protection of their fundamental rights as well as those of the Afro-Caribbean ethnic group inhabiting the islands of Providencia and Santa Catalina. Plaintiff invoked a violation of the rights to housing, drinking water, basic sanitation, healthy environment, health, access to public information, free, prior and informed consultation and cultural identity. Claimant argued that defendants violated their fundamental rights during the planning and execution of the action plan set in motion to aid the islands after being hit, in November 2020, by hurricane Iota, which destroyed 98% of the islands.

The case was heard by a lower court judge, who denied the protection on the basis of a lack of violation. The decision was supported on reports that showed the defendants took some actions to respond to the hurricane and guarantee the fundamental rights of the islanders. Plaintiff appealed, and the Tribunal upheld this decision.

The Constitutional Court (the Court) decided to exercise its judicial review and overturned the previous decisions. The Court found that the violation of the fundamental rights of the plaintiff and the Afro-Caribbean ethnic group was substantiated, and that some of these violations continued to this day, two years after the hurricane Iotas devastating pass through the islands. 

The Court ordered defendants to ensure the protection of the rights of islanders. The Court highlighted the differentiated impact of climate change on communities in vulnerable situations and invoked the obligations of the Colombian state in the protection of human rights affected by the climate crisis. The Court explicitly mentioned the obligations under the Paris Agreement (ratified by Colombia and included in the domestic legal framework through Law 1844 of 2017), particularly those obligations related to adaptation measures and efforts towards communities in vulnerable situations. 

Furthermore, the Court cited Resolution 3/21 (issued by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights and REDESCA) quoting the grave risk countries in the Caribbean experience due to sea level rise and increase in hurricanes and tropical storms. The Court also mentioned the Inter-American Court of Human Rights Advisory Opinion 23/17 to underscore the vulnerable situation in which Caribbean communities in Colombia live and the obligation of states to guarantee the right to public participation in decision making, among other environmental human rights.

The Court found that the violation of the fundamental rights of the islanders was the result of a lack of compliance by the Colombian government of its domestic and international obligations. The Court issued specific orders to make sure the governments response is adequate and highlighted that the comprehensive action plan to restore the islands had to consider Colombias obligations towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. In the Courts reasoning, climate change is the biggest threat to the enjoyment of human rights, which extends to mitigation and adaptation measures with a special emphasis on communities in vulnerable situations due to socio-economic and geographic factors.",decided,['Colombia>Constitutional Court'],['Suits against governments'],"['Colombia>Resolution 3/21', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']","Whether defendants violated their fundamental rights during the planning and execution of the action plan set in motion to aid the islands after being hit, in November 2020, by hurricane Iota.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/josefina-huffington-archbold-v-office-of-the-president-and-others/
Austria v. European Commission,"On 7 October 2022, Austria brought an action against the European Commission. It demanded the General Court annul Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of 9 March 2022, which qualifies investments in fossil gas and nuclear energy as environmentally sustainable. 

In 2020, the European legislator adopted the Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to direct investments toward sustainable projects and activities. Thereby, investments are considered environmentally sustainable if they involve one or several economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the criteria provided for in the Taxonomy Regulation. In 2021, the European Commission published Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, which specified technical screening criteria to determine whether an economic activity substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and causes no significant harm to other environmental objectives. In 2022, the Commission amended the delegated legal act and released Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, which includes specific activities relating to nuclear energy and fossil gas in the list of activities covered by the EU taxonomy. Nuclear energy and fossil gas investments thus qualify as environmentally sustainable investments under the Taxonomy Regulation.

Austria raised an action for annulment against Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for violating primary and secondary EU law. It relied on 16 pleas in law, eight of which relate to nuclear energy, the other eight to fossil gas. Austria claimed a violation of several provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, based on which Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 was adopted, as well as a violation of other (procedural) requirements and primary law. In concrete terms, the following claims were raised: 

First, Austria claimed a breach of procedural rules  allegedly, the Commission did not comply with the principles and procedural rules enshrined in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation) and the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making. In particular, the Commission wrongly omitted to conduct an impact assessment and public consultation. Also, it did not assess the compatibility of Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 with the European Climate Change Act, as required by Art 6 para 4 of the Act. 

Second, Austria asserted that the Commission was not competent to enact Regulation (EU) 2022/1214. According to the requirement of materiality under Art 290 TFEU, the Union legislature would have had to decide to include nuclear energy in the taxonomy. It did not adopt such a decision; therefore, Austria held that nuclear energy does not qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation. Further, it considered the precautionary principle to be violated. 

With regard to nuclear energy, Austria asserted that the qualification of nuclear energy as environmentally sustainable violates the do no significant harm-principle (DNSH principle) pursuant to Art 17 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as well as the precautionary principle under primary law. The Commission allegedly failed to recognise the risk of significantly impairing protected environmental objectives due to severe reactor accidents and high-level radioactive waste. In addition, Austria asserted a violation of individual requirements for technical screening criteria under Art 19 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as well as a violation of Art 10 para 2 and Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Arguably, nuclear energy does not meet the criteria set out in Art 10 para 2 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and does not substantially contribute to climate change adaptation as required by Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852. 

In terms of fossil gas, Austria asserted a violation of the DNSH principle since qualifying fossil gas as environmentally sustainable aggravates climate change. Besides, Austria considered Art 10 para 2 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the precautionary principle to be violated as technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives to fossil gas, which substantially contribute to climate change mitigation, already exist. In addition, Austria claimed that several of the requirements for technical screening criteria according to Art 19 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 were violated and brought forward a violation of Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as economic activities relating to fossil gas do not substantially contribute to climate change adaptation.

"R v. Brewer and others  (Just Stop Oil protest, Esso terminal, Birmingham)","Seven protestors were found guilty of aggravated trespass by obstructing operations at an Esso fuel terminal in Birmingham.

The campaign group, Just Stop Oil, held a protest at an Esso fuel terminal in Birmingham on the 3rd of April 2022. They were demanding an end to governmental support of new fossil fuel licences and projects. The 12 hour action meant that the fuel terminal was unable to operate as the protesters gathered within the site and in front of security barriers. The protest was part of a larger action taking place across England in conjunction with Extinction Rebellion. 

The defendants were sentenced in mid-February 2023 at the Wolverhampton Magistrates Court. Although a guilty verdict was reached for 7 of the 9 defendants, the judge was sympathetic to the cause of the protestors. 

There was a dispute as to what his sentencing remarks were. According to Just Stop Oil, he said, when noting the defendants admirable aims, that:

When the United Nations Secretary General gives a speech saying that the activity of fossil fuel companies is incompatible with human survival, we should all be very aware of the need for change. 

The BBC followed up with an article setting out what the Judicial Office understood to be the judges comments. That version was also sympathetic to the defendants however, noting their explanations for their actions were deeply emotive which moved the judge.

Campaign to Protect Rural England v Secretary of State for Transport (challenge to the A57 Link Roads Development Consent Order 2022),"In January the Campaign to Protect Rural England (CPRE), Peak District and South Yorkshire branch launched a legal challenge against the Secretary of State for Transports decision in November 2022 to grant development consent for a major new dual carriageway known as the trans-Pennine link road. The consent was granted via the A57 Link Roads Development Consent Order 2022. 

When making this Order the Transport Secretary accepted the scheme would result in an increase in carbon emissions but concluded that the proposed development is consistent with existing and emerging policy requirements to achieve the UKs trajectory towards net zero.

The challenge alleges the Transport Secretary failed to consider the environmental impacts of the scheme, including cumulative carbon emissions.

Challenges of this nature require the courts permission to proceed to trial, with permission applications usually dealt with early-on. Here, however, the court has ordered a rolled up hearing, where both the permission application and the substantive hearing will be heard together. It is not known whether a date has been set for the rolled up hearing.

Butler-Sloss &amp; Others v The Charity Commission for England And Wales &amp; Another,"This claim was brought by the trustees of two charities (the Ashden Trust and the Mark Leonard Trust; the Claimants), both of which have environmental protection or improvement as one of their main charitable purposes. The Claimants sought the Courts approval to adopt an investment strategy that would, as far as practicably possible, exclude investments that did not align with the goals of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which requires the 195 countries who are party to it to cut greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change. Though it is the nation signatories who must comply with the obligations, with private persons and charities not bound to it as such, the Claimants nonetheless chose the Paris Agreement as a benchmark with which to conclude that any investments that do not align with its goals are in direct conflict with their charitable purposes.

The Claimants were, however, concerned that adopting such an investment strategy would not be consistent with their fiduciary duties (and thereby be unlawful) as it would exclude many potential investments and may lead to financial detriment (if only in the short term). They therefore sought approval from the High Court to adopt this investment approach.

Their claim was defended by the Charity Commission and the Attorney-General. Though they supported the need for the court to clarify the effect of Harries v Church Commissioners for England [1991] 10 WLUK 372 (Bishop of Oxford) and set out the correct approach in law for charity trustees, they argued that it was premature for the court to approve the claimants' investment policies based on the available evidence.

On April 29, 2022, the High Court gave judgment, with Green J approving the strategy and deciding that the Claimants ha[d] exercised their powers of investment properly and lawfully [Judgment at #88]. 

Green J set out ten legal principles that summarise the correct approach in law for charity trustees to follow when considering adopting an ethical approach to investment [Judgment at #78]. More specifically, he held that Bishop of Oxford did not lay down an absolute prohibition on making investments that directly conflict with the charity's purposes, and instead confirmed that, where trustees are of the reasonable view that investments or classes of investment may conflict with the charitable purposes and thereby risk losing donors or damaging the reputation of the charity, the trustees have a discretion as to whether to exclude such investments [Judgment at #78(6)]. That discretion should be exercised by reasonably balancing all relevant factors, including the extent of the potential conflict against the risk of financial detriment. Green J concluded that, if that balancing exercise is properly done and a reasonable and proportionate investment policy is thereby adopted, the trustees will have complied with their legal duties [Judgment at #78(10)]. In this case, Green J considered that the Claimants had sufficiently balanced these factors and so their proposed investment policy was lawful. Green J made the requested declaration that permits charity trustees to adopt a policy that aligns their charities investments with their charitable purposes, even though it may risk reducing financial returns.

On November 15, 2022 the government issued a formal response to the judgment and its implications for investment guidance. That confirmed the Charity Commission will publish updated guidance by summer 2023.",decided,['United Kingdom>England and Wales>High Court of Justice'],['Suits against governments>Trade and Investment'],['United Kingdom>Trustee Act 2000'],Whether charitable trustees can legitimately take into account non-financial considerations when exercising their powers of investment.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/butler-sloss-others-v-the-charity-commission-for-england-and-wales-another/

That Regulation, aimed at investor protection, requires companies to disclose certain specific and material risks they face. 

The FCA approved Ithacas prospectus. This resulted, in February 2023, in ClientEarth issuing a claim for judicial review. ClientEarth argue the climate risks associated with Ithacas business were not adequately disclosed, putting the FCA in breach of the Regulation when approving the prospectus. In particular:
	Although Ithacas prospectus includes a climate-related risk factor, the risks disclosed are of too general a nature to leave investors fully informed or to meet the Regulation requirements. Ithaca does not appear to explain how these risks affect its business specifically, or how significant these risks are for the company.
	The prospectus does not address the apparent conflict between Ithacas intention to develop new fossil fuel assets that would operate for decades and the International Energy Agencys conclusion that no new fuel fossil fuel infrastructure can be built if the world is to meet a 1.5 warming target.
	Ithaca fails to explain how its business model and financial prospectus would need to change, or be affected, if the Paris Agreement goals are to be achieved and what impact that would have on their key assets, which include Cambo and Rosebank.
	The above information is vital to investors if they are to make an informed assessment of the company's financial position and therefore should have been provided in the prospectus.

"Greenpeace Ltd v (1) Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and (2) the Oil and Gas Authority; and Uplift v (1) SSBEIS and (2) the OGA (North Sea oil and gas licensing)","In September 2022:
	The Secretary of State adopted the Climate Compatibility Checkpoint. The purported aim of this policy was to ensure that, before a new North Sea oil and gas licensing round is offered, the compatibility of future licensing with the UKs climate objectives is evaluated. 
	The Secretary of States officials completed the fourth offshore energy strategic environmental assessment (OESEA4). This was to enable, amongst other activities, further offshore oil and gas licensing in the North Sea. It was produced pursuant to the Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004.
	The Secretary of State also endorsed a further licensing round being launched by the North Sea Transition Authority (NSTA - this being the trading name of the Oil and Gas Authority).
	The NSTA announced it was satisfied a further licensing round met the Checkpoints requirements. 

In October 2022 the NSTA, pursuant to its powers under Part 1 of the Petroleum Act 1998, launched the 33rd Offshore Oil and Gas Licensing Round. This is expected to result in the grant of a further 100 licences.

As a result of the above, in December 2022 separate claims for judicial review were launched by environmental charities Greenpeace and Uplift. In April 2023 both claims were granted permission to proceed to trial. It is not known whether a trial date has been set.

Greenpeace notes the government did not take account of downstream emissions, i.e. from when the oil and gas is ultimately used, for example in fuelling cars. Greenpeace states that ""this is a glaring omission from the government's decision making, including its climate compatibility check"". In its written response the government argued there was an insufficient causal connection between the extraction of oil and gas and the downstream emissions arising from its consumption to enable a meaningful assessment of the environmental effects of the latter"".

Uplift argues:
	The adoption of OESEA4 was unlawful because, among other matters, the Secretary of State failed to take into account expert advice on industry targets, failed to assess downstream emissions and failed to properly assess reasonable alternatives.
	The endorsement of the 33rd licensing round was unlawful because the Secretary of State failed to provide any reasons for a new licensing round being compatible with the Checkpoint and the UKs climate objectives.
	The decision to adopt the Checkpoint was unlawful because it excluded a test that would have required the Secretary of State to consider downstream emissions on the basis of reasons that were legally irrelevant and irrational. A further test, which would have required consideration of the global production gap was also unlawfully excluded, on the basis of an erroneous interpretation of the obligations imposed by the Paris Agreement.

To the extent both challenges include arguments on the assessment of end-use emissions, they will potentially be impacted by outcome of the appeal in R (Finch on behalf of the Weald Action Group & Others) v. Surrey County Council (& Others). The Supreme Court will hear that appeal on 21 June 2023.

Individuals v. Germany,"In December 2022, the German Constitutional Court dismissed a complaint by two individuals against the German legislature for failing to standardise legal pathways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, in particular by introducing a speed limit on Germany highways. The individuals submitted that German law required these pathways to ensure a timely, transparent and fair distribution of the burdens associated with the reduction of greenhouse gases to ensure the protection of future rights and freedoms  as required by Article 20a of the Constitution.  

The individuals submitted that the measures taken to reduce CO2 emissions in the transport sector were insufficient to meet the emission levels required by the Climate Protection Act by 2030. The complaint was dismissed as inadmissible. The Court held that the complainants did not sufficiently substantiate their claim, failing to show that there would be considerable restrictions on fundamental freedoms by the end of the decade, because the allowable emissions for the transport sector were being used up too quickly. The Court also held that it was not evidenced why further emissions reductions had to be achieved through the means of a speed limit.

Instituto Internacional Arayara v. IBAMA and others,"On October 28, 2022, the NGO, Instituto Internacional Arayara filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) against the National Environmental Agency (Instituto Brasileiro do Meio Ambiente e dos Recursos Naturais Renovaveis  IBAMA), the Federal Union, the Rio de Janeiros State Environmental Agency (Instituto Estadual do Meio Ambiente  INEA), the State of Rio de Janeiro, and the companies EDF Norte Fluminense S.A. - Usina Termeletrica Norte Fluminense S.A., Global Participacoes em Energia S.A., Usina Termeletrica Nossa Senhora de Fatima and Litos Energia Ltda. The plaintiff seeks the annulment of the previous environmental licenses issued by IBAMA for thermoelectric projects located in the municipality of Macae, in the state of Rio de Janeiro. It also seeks the annulment of the (i) water resources use right grants and (ii) Water Availability Reserve Certificates referring to the Macae and Ostras River Hydrographic Basin, granted by INEA for the same projects. The plaintiff institution defends that the installation of a thermoelectric complex in the region, consisting of eighteen enterprises, is contrary to the need for investment in a clean energy matrix and the fight against climate change. It argues that there should be a determination that licensing agencies require, prior to issuing licenses: (i) a Strategic Environmental Assessment (AAE) for the analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts of enterprises to be installed in the same hydrographic basin; (ii) the updating of the plan of the Hydrographic Basin of the Macae and Ostras River and the study of water availability of the Basin; and (iii) the presentation of a Climate Diagnosis, with an inventory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by the enterprises.

The plaintiff argues that the failure to conduct AAE prior to the issuance of the licenses invalidates the administrative procedures already carried out, since it was not possible to investigate the various cumulative impacts of the activities to be licensed. It is emphasized that emissions of pollutants by thermoelectric plants contribute to air pollution, damage to human health, and loss of agricultural productivity. From the climatic point of view, it is argued that in order to keep the limit of planetary temperature increase at 1.5C, to fulfill the commitments made in the Paris Agreement, COP 26 and NDCs, the installation of new enterprises that use fossil fuels cannot be allowed. The plaintiff highlights the consolidation of jurisprudence favorable to environmental and climate issues at the Supreme Federal Court, exemplified by the judgment of ADPF 708 (Climate Fund), which recognizes that current Brazilian measures to address climate change are in disagreement with its international commitments. The plaintiff requests, as a preliminary injunction the suspension of the environmental licensing processes of the plants until the defects in the Environmental Impact Studies (EIA/RIMAs) and the defects related to atmospheric dispersions are remedied, including, among others (i) the determination that the Climate Diagnosis be presented and considered for the analysis of the environmental licensing processes, (ii) IBAMA be ordered to include the guidelines set forth in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the guidelines of the Rio de Janeiro State Policy on Climate Change, and the preparation of a AAE in the terms of reference of the licensing processes for the power plants and (iii) the companies be ordered to refrain from construction work and activities at the thermoelectric complex until the AAE, basin plan update, hydric availability study, and other studies required in the lawsuit have been conducted. In the final stage, it is requested that the preliminary injunction be confirmed, reiterating the requests, with the inclusion of the requirements for the annulment of the environmental licensing processes, licenses and permits already granted by the environmental agencies.

Federal Public Prosecutors Office (MPF) v. INEA and Karpowership Brasil Energia Ltda.,"On March 25, 2022, the Federal Public Prosecutors Office (Minsterio Publico Federal - MPF) filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class action) against the Rio de Janeiros State Environmental Agency (Instituto Estadual do Meio Ambiente  INEA), and the company Karpowership Brasil Energia Ltda. due to alleged irregularities in the environmental licensing process of 36 temporary towers for power transmission lines in Sepetiba Bay, Rio de Janeiro. The plaintiff informs that INEA, when granting the Integrated environmental license disregarded the synergistic and cumulative impacts with the request for a license to install and operate four floating Thermoelectric Plants in the same region, which are part of the same project. It argues that both the temporary towers for power transmission lines and the floating Thermoelectric Plants should be analyzed together and that there was an absence of an Environmental Impact Study/Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) and of a public hearing with the participation of the local community. The MPF points out that thermoelectric enterprises are generators of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution. For this reason, INEA should require prior studies to assess the contribution of the project to climate change, taking into account the objectives of the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.189/2009) and the goals assumed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement.It raises the special protection of the Atlantic Forest biome (under Federal Law 11.428/2006) when it comes to suppression of vegetation. The MPF bases its claim on the duty of the Public Authorities to defend and preserve the ecologically balanced environment provided for in article 225 of the Federal Constitution. 

Among other measures, the plaintiff requests the preliminary suspension of the license and, definitively, the: (i) declaration of its nullity; (ii) evaluation of the project considering its contribution to climate change, so as to ensure that emissions are mitigated; (iii) determination that INEA abstain from granting licenses without conducting an EIA; (iv) determination that INEA considers, after the presentation of the EIA/RIMA, the global analysis of the licensing, considering the cumulative and synergistic effects of the projects; (v) determination that the defendants to recover the already deforested areas and the existing environmental liabilities; and (vi) determination that the defendants compensate for the damages caused, considering their material and extra-patrimonial nature, including collective moral damages.

On September 25, 2022, the judge dismissed the case without resolution of the merits, on procedural grounds. It emphasized that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of (i) lack of standing to sue on the part of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF); (ii) absolute lack of jurisdiction of the court; and (iii) lack of interest in suing on the grounds of inadequacy of the chosen legal avenue.",Pending,['Brazil>Rio de Janeiro>Rio de Janeiro Federal Court'],"['Suits against governments>Energy and power', 'Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Environmental assessment and permitting']","['Brazil>National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225', 'Brazil>Complementary Law 140/201', 'Brazil>PNMC (Federal Law 12 187/2009)', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",Whether the permitting of towers for power transmission lines should be analyzed together with  the project of floating Thermoelectric Plants considering its cumulative and synergic impacts and  its contribution to climate change. ,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-public-prosecutors-office-mpf-vs-inea-and-karpowership-brasil-energia-ltda/
Altroconsumo v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A,"In 2016, an Italian NGO (Altroconsumo), representing over 63,000 individuals who had bought Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda vehicles in the relevant period, started a class action against Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A (""VWAG"" and ""VWGI"", together ""Volkswagen"") before the Court of Venice, seeking a declaration that they engaged in unfair commercial practices against Italian consumers. The case is the Italian spin-off of the so called ""Dieselgate scandal"" which exploded in 2015, when the [US] Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified the German carmaker an alleged emissions standard violation. It was later discovered that, between 2009 and 2015, Volkswagen had employed a particular piece of software (the so-called defeat device) that allowed some vehicles with diesel engines to pass emissions standards test that they would otherwise have failed.
The Italian class action followed the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (""ICA""), which held Volkswagen liable for unfair commercial practices under articles 20, 21 and 23 of the Italian Consumers Code and issued a fine of  5 million (see, Italian Competition Authority v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A, which is still ongoing.

Altroconsumo claimed that Volkswagen (i) falsely stated the level of the polluting emissions of Volkswagen-branded EA 189 diesel vehicles (by installing the so-called defeat device to falsify the result of the emission tests) and (ii) engaged in advertising campaigns presenting its vehicles as having specific green features able to protect the environment by reducing CO2 emissions: such ""green claims"" were false and deceptive, and constituted a misleading commercial practice prohibited by the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive no. 2005/29/CE (implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 145/2007). Altroconsumo therefore argued that Italian consumers' right to freedom of contract was breached and that they had suffered direct financial loss, equal to the decrease in value of the vehicle(s) they have bought because it did not possess the promised green qualities.

Volkswagen denied Altroconsumo's allegations and raised a series of preliminary objections which were all rejected.
The Court of first instance upheld Altroconsumo's claims and found that the defendants were responsible for using misleading, and at times false, ""green claims"" in their marketing and advertising activities. The Court awarded damages, amounting to Euro 3,000 for each member of the class action in financial damage, plus Euro 300 in moral damage (over Euro 200M in total), plus legal expenses. According to the Court of first instance, Volkswagen's conduct potentially misled consumers and such potential effect was enough to draw a causal link between Volkswagen's behaviour and the damage suffered by the consumers, as it was presumed  in the absence of evidence to the contrary  that consumers were influenced in their commercial choices by Volkswagen's 'green claims'. To reach its conclusions, the Court of first instance relied on reasoning expressed by the Italian Supreme Court in prospectus liability cases where a similar presumption applies.

"Greenpeace Italy et. Al. v.

(""ENI"") for its contribution to global warming. The lawsuit also includes ENI's two majority shareholders, namely the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (""MEF"") and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. (""CDP""), which have the power to strongly influence the company's policies. The case is built on the landmark decision Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc, which ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019, across all activities including both its own emissions and end-use emissions. According to the claimants, ENIs own decarbonization strategy is not in line with the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the best available climate science recommendations to limit climate impacts. It is alleged that ENI's conduct not only contributes to climate change, with all that it entails in terms of environmental risks and health consequences, it also violates human rights that are safeguarded and protected both by the Italian Constitution and by international norms and agreements. Besides, MEF and CDP are also deemed responsible for ENI's climate inaction, as, thanks to the ENI's shares held directly and indirectly, they have sufficient votes to exercise a dominant influence in the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of ENI, which is equivalent to a situation of ""control"" of the State over the same company participated.

On the basis of the above, the claimants are asking the Court of Rome to declare ENI, MEF and CDP jointly and severally liable for past and potential future damages to fundamental rights, such as the right to health, safety, and property and for putting, and continuing to put, in danger the same assets of the applicants because of the consequences of climate change.

Claimants are also seeking an order against ENI MEF and CDP to adopt an industrial strategy to reduce the climate-changing CO2 emissions associated with its operations by 45% by 2030 against the companys 2020 baseline, in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement. The claimants request the application of the new astreinte tool, asking to condemn ENI to pay a monetary sum to be determined by the judge for any violation or non-compliance with or delay in the execution of the obtaining order.

Italian Competition Authority v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A,"In 2015, the Italian Competition Authority (""ICA"") started an investigation against Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A. and Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft (""VWGI"" and ""VWAG"" and together ""Volkswagen"") for alleged unfair commercial practices and breach of the Italian Consumers Code. The investigation on Volkswagen was trigged by consumer associations' allegations of false declarations made by Volkswagen when marketing its EA 189 diesel vehicles in relation to (i) the level of polluting emissions of such vehicles (Volkswagen were accused to have installed the so-called defeat device to falsify the result of the emission tests) and to (ii) their specific green features. In 2016, the ICA's investigation ended: the ICA found Volkswagen liable for unfair commercial practices and for breach of articles 20, 21 and 23 of the Italian Consumers Code, as Volkswagen failed to describe the positive environmental impacts of their EA 189 diesel vehicles in a clear, truthful, accurate, and unambiguous way. Because of such breach, the ICA issued a fine of  5 million. In 2016, Volkswagen appealed the decision issued by the ICA before the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, seeking the annulment of the  5 million fine. 

With a decision issued in May 2019, the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio rejected Volkswagen's appeal confirming the ICA decision and the fine of  5 million. The Administrative Court held that Volkswagen's green claims were misleading for the fact that, on one hand, Volkswagen emphasized its care for the environment, and, on the other hand, he installed in the marketed diesel vehicles a defeat device to falsify the result of the emission tests.

In 2019, Volkswagen appealed the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio's decision before the Supreme Administrative Court (Consiglio di Stato). The proceedings are still pending.

(Al) filed a request to obtain interim injunction against one of its main Italian competitors who markets a suede-like microfiber product, Miko S.r.l. (Miko), before the Court of Gorizia (a town in the North of Italy). According to Al, Miko advertised its suede-like microfiber product to the public as having many green features and promoted it as environmentally friendly. The ""green claims"" made by the Miko included statements such as ""made of recycled polyester"", ""environmentally friendly, natural choice, eco-friendly microfiber, the first and only microfiber that guarantees environmental sustainability throughout the productive cycle, the first sustainable and recyclable microfiber, 100% recyclable, 100% recyclable at the end of its lifecycle, reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions by 80%, reduction of carbon footprint through polyester recycling, absence of harmful substances, use of non-harmful dyes, and use of neutral and non-toxic dyes.

Al argued that Miko's ""green claims"" constituted an act of unfair competition under Article 2598, 3 of the Italian Civil Code in the form of misleading advertising as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive no. 2005/29/CE (implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 145/2007), alleging that the claims were vague, false, non-verified or non-verifiable.

Higher Regional Court Frankfurt am Main on carbon neutral hygiene II,"The advertising of a company producing ecologic cleaning supplies was challenged on grounds of misleading advertising. The company had previously advertised its products as climate neutral. The applicant challenged the use of the label, as the company did not specify whether all of its emissions formed part of these calculations, or which ones were excluded; did not indicate the scope of its reduction measures; or specify the type of offset. On the basis of the act against unfair competition, the applicant submitted that the term climate neutral needed more clarification than what was provided by the company.

The Higher Regional Court overturned, in part, the findings of the lower court. It held that information was required as to whether the term climate neutrality used in the advertising was achieved in whole or in part through offsetting measures. Clarification was also required, as to whether certain emissions were excluded from the emissions reporting. Finally, information needed to be included that provided context on the criteria used for the climate neutral seal. The company was ordered to cease certain forms of advertising.

Pira Parana Indigenous Council and Association of Indigenous Traditional Authorities of river Pira Parana ACAIPI v. Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and others,"On July 15, 2022, the Pira Parana Indigenous Council and the Association of Indigenous Traditional Authorities of river Pira Parana ACAIPI filed a tutela arguing the violation of their fundamental and human rights to self-determination, cultural integrity, autonomous governing and territory. Defendants in this case are the private companies that are implementing REDD+ projects in their territory and the environmental authorities in charge of authorizing and monitoring the projects. 

Plaintiffs argue that the REDD+ projects violate their fundamental and human rights as a result of (i) a lack of human rights due diligence by the private companies, and (ii) the failure of the government to protect their rights. Plaintiffs contend that all climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, projects and programs must protect and ensure the enjoyment of Indigenous fundamental rights in their respective territories. Particularly, plaintiffs claim that the Colombian legal framework ought to incorporate human rights standards regarding the implementation of REDD+ projects to ensure mitigation measures that aim towards environmental protection do not violate human rights. Likewise, plaintiffs assert that due diligence conducted by the private companies must include human rights standards, which was not the case. Plaintiffs argue that the private companies deliberatively ignored and excluded the Indigenous authorities.

The case was first heard by a judge, who rejected the plaintiffs arguments. The judges reasoning is based on the subsidiary nature of the tutela mechanism, which is an expedite procedure only available in case regular mechanisms are inadequate to ensure the protection of the plaintiffs rights. The judge found that the plaintiffs have indeed other judicial mechanisms to challenge the defendants actions and declared that the tutela was not adequate in this case. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and the Administrative Tribunal upheld the judges decision. 

On April 28, 2023, the Colombian Constitutional Court (the Court) exercised its judicial review and selected this case for review. The case will now be heard by the Courts Justices, who will have the opportunity to study the REDD+ projects for the first time, in what could become a precedent for other carbon emission and climate change mitigation activities particularly regarding Indigenous communities rights. The Court deemed it important to provide a clear judicial guideline as to the way these and similar projects are being implemented as well as whether the tutela is the adequate mechanism to challenge the projects, especially with regard to Indigenous rights.",Pending,['Colombia>Constitutional Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations', 'Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment']","['Colombia>Law 1753 of 2015', 'Colombia>Resolution 1447 of 2018', 'Colombia>Constitution']","Whether defendants violated the plaintiffs human rights to self-determination, cultural integrity, autonomous governing and territory by approving and implementing the REDD+ projects in their territories.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/1pira-parana-indigenous-council-and-association-of-indigenous-traditional-authorities-of-river-pira-parana-acaipi-v-ministry-of-environment-and-sustainable-development-and-others/
ACCC Carbon Neutral Claims,"The Australia Institute, a public policy think tank based in Canberra, Australia, alleged in a complaint that the Climate Active trademark program is misleading and deceptive under Australian Consumer Law and referred the program to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) for investigation. 

The Climate Active program is a partnership between the Australian Government and Australian businesses that certifies businesses and organizations that have ""proven that they are measuring, reducing and offsetting their emissions, with a net result of zero emissions"". Climate Active state that ""by supporting these organizations you are casting your vote for a better environment"". 

The Australia Institute is concerned that Climate Active's claims about its certification program are potentially misleading, because:

- ""Carbon neutral organizations"" under the program are not always required to reduce their emissions;
- On the contrary, ""carbon neutral organizations"" can be contributing emissions in their operations or through their products or services;
- ""Carbon neutral products"" are often not reducing a company's emissions but merely paying for offsets for its emissions;
- The Climate Active trademarks do not make clear the details of how the program works or disclaimers in relation to the claims made.

Deutsche Umwelthilfe v. TotalEnergies Warme &amp; Kraftstoff Deutschland GmbH,"In 2022, Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH) filed legal action against TotalEnergies due to an advertising statement concerning ""CO2-compensated heating oil."" TotalEnergies claimed to offset the CO2 emissions of the oil as part of its climate plan. DUH argued that this advertising claim constituted misleading commercial practices, and was thus in breach of article 5a of the Act Against Unfair Competition. First, DUH criticized that the measures implemented to achieve the alleged climate neutrality of the advertised oil were insufficiently presented. Second, DUH criticized the offsetting measures to reach CO2 neutrality, namely, the purchase of emission credits for a forest protection project in the Madre de Dios region, Peru (ClimatePartner Tambopata forest protection project). This case is part of a series of DUH legal proceedings concerning climate neutrality advertising promises.

"RCC Ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 2","At the core of the complaint was an advertisement by Shell displaying a Shell truck with an image of a rainforest in the background stating: ""I AM CO2 NEUTRAL. ON THE WAY. ARE YOU?"" The complainant alleged that Shell's statement on CO2 neutrality was misleading, referring to Shell's inaction on reducing CO2 emissions and the nature of Shell's business. The complainant referred to the District Court of the Hague's judgment on 26 May 2021 in Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc. to highlight Shell's intentions. The complainant also argued that the rainforest wrongly suggested that Shell helped with the preservation of the rainforest. Shell, on the other hand, argued that it used carbon offsetting to reach carbon neutrality. Shell also argued that the ""I"" referred to the displayed truck, and not the company as a whole. Lastly, Shell stated that the rainforest was an example of the CO2 compensation programs. The RCC held that the slogan could be interpreted in various ways, and that it was unclear that it only referred to the truck. The RCC considered the slogan to be misleading as the cargo (fossil fuel) and the company itself were not CO2 neutral. Thus, the RCC considered the advertisement to be in breach of article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising. In its ruling, the RCC referred to the reasoning of the RCC's Ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1.",Decided,['Netherlands>Reclame Code Commissie (RCC)'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Misleading advertising']",['Netherlands>Code for Environmental Advertising>Article 2'],Whether Shell's advertisement on Shell's truck is misleading because it implies that Shell is CO2 neutral,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/rcc-ruling-on-shell-drive-co2-neutral-2/
"RCC Ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1","The contested advertisement contained several statements by Shell in the campaign ""Make a difference. Drive CO2 neutral,"" specifically on Shell's website. The complaint alleged that Shell falsely claimed that the damage caused by CO2 emissions can be offset or neutralized through voluntary carbon credits. The complaint was based on various scientific reports, including the IPCC Synthesis Report in 2014. The Committee held that the average consumers would understand the term ""neutralized"" to mean that the harm caused by CO2 emissions was completely compensated by offsetting measures. This impression was reinforced by the manner that Shell issued an explanation of the campaign on its website. While the RCC acknowledged that Shell had plausibly demonstrated that it followed certain standards and guidelines, it pointed out that Shell did not guarantee the full offsetting in practice. The RCC stressed that article 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC) set a high bar with regards to environmental claims which must be demonstrably correct. Against this background, Shell's claim were too absolute, as they guaranteed a result which was not certain.

The complaint was in line with the previous ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1 in which the RCC held that Shell's advertising was in breach of articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). After the ruling, Shell had replaced ""CO2 neutral"" with ""CO2 compensation."" The complainants argued that these terms were synonymous and that an average consumer would understand the compensation claims as undoing the climatic harm caused by fossil fuels. But Shell had not provided the scientific evidence that the promised offsetting actually led to this result in practice. The Committee found this claim not to be different from the previously assessed ""CO2 neutral"" claim. Thus, the Committee found the claim to be misleading and in breach of articles 2 and 3 MRC.

"RCC Ruling on Arla ""climate neutral milk""","The contested advertising concerned the statement ""climate neutral"" for Arla organic dairy on the product packaging, the website, and in videos and commercials. The complainant argued that such claims implied that the milk had no effect on the climate. Because this environmental claim could not be substantiated, it allegedly violated articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). The Committee was of the view that an average consumer would interpret these claims in the sense that the production of the products had no impact on the climate in that adverse affects were completely cancelled out. The Committee referred to a previous ruling on Shell ""Drive CO2 neutral"" 1. After giving the defendant the opportunity to provide more information in an interim decision, the Committee found that Arla had not demonstrated the absolute certainty required with regard to the full and permanent offsetting of emissions through its forest projects. Thus, the accuracy of an absolute claim such as ""climate neutral"" had not been demonstrated as required by article 3 MRC. The advertising was therefore in breach of article 2 MRC. Arla subsequently appealed this decision, arguing that it met all the established and highest standards for claiming climate neutrality. Specifically, Arla stated that its ""climate neutral"" claim was a relative and not an absolute one, as the claim related to a label and that it was entitled to use this label for its products. Therefore, Arla argued that this case differentiated from previous cases which had involved absolute claims. The appeal body confirmed the decision of the RCC in part. It found that Arla's statements were misleading to the extent that there was no clarification that the claim specifically related to the label. Thus, the appeal body found the statements to be misleading within article 2 MRC and in conjunction with article 8.3(a),(c) of the Dutch Advertising Code.

"RCC Ruling on Chiquita ""climate neutral bananas""","The contested advertising concerned a sticker on Chiquita's bananas which included the statement ""CO2 Neutral."" The complaint alleged that Chiquita's ""CO2 Neutral"" claim was not true.

The Commission found the sticker on the bananas with the claim ""CO2 Neutral"" to be misleading pursuant to article 2 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC), as it did not contain any reference to information about the interpretation of this claim. Because any context was lacking, the meaning of this claim was unclear to the average consumer. The Committee noted that the meaning of the environmental claim had had to be made clear in the advertisement. The Committee found it insufficient that the meaning of ""CO2 Neutral"" was clarified on a separate website. It also noted that the mere mention of a website was insufficient to make the meaning of the claim clear. Because the claims were admissible on the basis of the foregoing, the Committee did not have to examine the question whether Chiquita was able to demonstrate the correctness of its absolute environmental claim pursuant to article 3 MRC.

"Friends of the Earth Hungary v. Veszprem County Government Office, Municipality of the Village of Tihany","In June 2021, the Municipality of the Village of Tihany (hereafter: the Municipality) submitted a request for a screening procedure regarding a planned tourist development near Lake Balaton, the largest freshwater lake in Central Europe. The project included a visitor center, an open-air visitor area, and a car parking lot. The screening documentation covered a number of issues, ranging from noise via air pollution to nature conservation. With regard to climate issues, the documentation briefly found that the implementation of the project would not be influenced by climate change. The Veszprem County Government Office (hereafter: the Defendant) issued a decision in July 2021, declaring that the planned project would have no significant impact on the environment and therefore there would be no need to perform an Environmental Impact Assessment.

Friends of the Earth Hungary (hereafter: the Plaintiff) filed a lawsuit against the Defendant in August 2021. In its file, the Plaintiff claimed that the climate chapter of the screening documentation is lacking actual content. It claimed that the planned project is obviously linked to water related tourism, and as such, will be heavily influenced by climate change. It also claimed that due to this, the decision of the Defendant to not require an Environmental Impact Assessment is unlawful and breaches the Government Decree on EIA that requires the detailed presentation of climate change related information in screening documentations before decision-making.

The Defendant in its counter-argument claimed that the project would be implemented further away from the waterfront and not directly at the lake shore; therefore, any climatic change in the lake would not have an effect on the project and the project would not be sensitive to climate change.The Municipality that intervened on behalf of the Defendant agreed with the arguments of the Defendant.

In November 2021, the court declared its judgment and annulled the decision of the Defendant, while ordering the defendant to restart the screening process and reassess the need for an Environmental Impact Assessment, putting more emphasis on the climate change aspects of the project.The court spelled out the following in its judgment:

The court found from the content of the documentation that climate protection analyses or climate risk assessments other than a brief table are not included, and the data of the latter table contradicts to known facts.

Detailed sensitivity analysis, the exposure of the site and impact area of the project, the evaluation of certain impacts, the evaluation of risks and the adaptation of the planned project to climate change are not included. Presentation of how the planned project will have an effect on the areas adaptation potential is also missing.

NZ Students for Climate Solutions and UK Youth Climate Coalition v. Board of BP,"Students for Climate Solutions New Zealand and the UK Youth Climate Coalition have submitted a request to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation against BP Senior Executives. The submission argues that BP Senior Executives allegedly committed a crime against humanity by knowingly causing and perpetuating climate change while pursuing activities in the oil and gas industry. The submission alleges that since the 1950s, BP Senior Executives have been aware of the climate implications of the corporations oil and gas activities because of internal studies conducted into
greenhouse gases. The results of these studies have allegedly been withheld from the public. The submission further argues that as of the 1990s, BP Senior Executives have admitted their role in perpetuating climate change in company documentaries where a link was made between the corporations activities and climate change. In prioritizing profits from oil activities, BP Senior Executives are alleged to have engaged in the following harmful behaviors:
- Creating doubt by sowing distrust in climate change science
- Entrenching dependency on BPs petroleum products on the false pretense that they are a necessary and viable solution to climate change
- Causing delays to urgent climate policy by portraying climate change as a far-future issue
- Fostering deception of governments and the wider public through misleading marketing of BP as a renewable energy company, using strategic communications to shift responsibilities for carbon emissions onto individuals, and promoting false solutions, such as yet-to-be- invented technology, that prolong the use of fossil fuels
- Ensuring dominance through attempts to control and influence political processes via systematic lobbying and campaign financing.

Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Mato Grosso v. Nelson Noboru Yabuta,"On October 27, 2010, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Mato Grosso filed a Public Civil Action (class action) against Nelson Noboru Yabuta, aiming to hold him accountable for environmental damage caused by the degradation of native vegetation. The lawsuit sought urgent injunctive relief, environmental regularization of the Luana I and II farms, and compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiff accused Yabuta of illegally deforesting 119,584 hectares in a Permanent Preservation Area (APP), in Juara, Mato Grosso, without authorization from the environmental agency.

An initial injunction was issued, prohibiting any unlicensed activities on the farms. Subsequently, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering Yabuta to pay 20,000 Brazilian Reais (about USD $4,000) as compensation for collective moral damages resulting from the environmental harm. Both parties appealed. Yabuta argued that the Infraction Notice, which was one of the foundations of the lawsuit, had been annulled. The plaintiff contended that the court should recognize the obligations outlined in the Conduct Adjustment Agreement, a pact made between Yabuta and the state environmental agency, to strengthen its enforcement.

On February 21, 2017, the Court of Justice of Mato Grosso dismissed the appeals, upholding Yabuta's conviction and his responsibility to compensate for collective moral damages. The court emphasized that the cancellation of the administrative infraction notice did not absolve
him of liability in other domains, as environmental crimes entail triple liabilitycriminal, administrative, and civil. It was proven that Yabuta had unlawfully deforested the APP and Legal Reserve of the property, disregarding the necessary authorization. His actions, driven by cattle-raising activities, posed a risk of forest desertification, thereby compromising the quality of life for the local population due to climate change and excessive greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).",Decided,['Brazil>Mato Grosso'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage']","['National Environmental Policy (PNMA)', 'Forest Code (Law 12.651/2012)', 'Federal Constitution>225', 'Environmental Crimes Law', 'UNFCCC>Paris Agreement']",The Public Prosecutors Office seeks the recovery of a degraded area and compensation for collective moral damages due to deforestation in a protected area without authorization from the environmental agency.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/public-prosecutors-office-of-the-state-of-mato-grosso-v-nelson-noboru-yabuta/
"A.S. &amp; S.A. &amp; E.N.B v. Presidency of Turkiye &amp; The Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change","Three young climate activists in Turkey brought a new case to the Council of State on May 8th 2023. Turkey submitted the country's ""Updated First NDC"" to the UNFCCC Secretariat on April 13th, 2023. The NDC states that ""Turkey confirms to reduce its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 41% through 2030 (695 Mt CO2 eq in year 2030) compared to the Business as Usual (BAU) scenario given in Turkey's first NDC (also INDC) considering 2012 as the base year (reference year). Turkey's updated first NDC is economy-wide and includes comprehensive mitigation and adaptation actions as well as consideration of means of implementation. Turkey intends to peak its emissions at the latest in the year 2038.""

Alleging that these goals are not sufficient, the Claimants applied to the Council of State and filed a lawsuit against President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and The Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change, requesting the annulment of NDC. The Claimants asserted that the updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) submitted by Turkey are ""climate inaction rather than climate action."" Underlining the lack of a transparent process in the preparation of the NDC, they demanded the
annulment and renewal of Turkey's unscientific, ineffective, and inadequate climate target.

In their campaign, declaring that holding climate change at 1.5 degrees is a human right, the Claimants state that Turkey's decision to increase greenhouse gas emissions, which is incompatible with the Paris Climate Agreement's goal of holding climate change at 1.5 degrees, violates their human rights. The progress of the climate crisis violates the right

Instituto Verdeluz and others v. Portocem Geracao de Energia S.A. and SEMACE,"On May 31st, 2023, the NGO Instituto Verdeluz, the Indigenous Council of the Anace People of Japiman, and the Indigenous Association of the Anace People of the Planalto Cauipe Village filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) against the company Portocem Geracao de Energia S.A. and the Secretary of the Environment of the State of Ceara (Secretaria do Meio Ambiente do Estado do Ceara  SEMACE). The plaintiffs seek the suspension and subsequent annulment of the environmental licensing process of the Portocem Thermoelectric Plant (UTE), powered by natural gas, which is to be installed in the Pecem Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP). They claim there is non-compliance with legal norms and several omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), including (i) the concealment of indigenous communities in the vicinity of the project, (ii) the disregard of impacts related to water resources, (iii) the disregard of potential socioeconomic impacts, (iv) the underestimation of damage to health, and (v) the disregard of climate impacts. They also believe that there was no adequate analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts with other enterprises in the region, considering their insertion in an Industrial Complex. In relation to climate impacts, the plaintiffs argue that the EIA failed to list important consequences for climate stability. They mention the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and how the use of fossil fuels is incompatible with the guiding principles of the national energy policy. They argue that Brazil and the state of Ceara have made a legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which goes against the implementation of a new gas-fired thermoelectric plant. The plaintiffs also point out that the Northeast is one of the regions in Brazil most vulnerable to climate change and stress the importance of the risk analysis of the project to the water security of the region, considering that the water resources of the Northeast are under pressure from climate change. On top of the problems in the impact assessment, the plaintiffs also state flaws in the licensing process due to the lack of effective public participation. In this sense, they question the lack of prior, free, and informed consultation with the indigenous Anace people. They believe that there was a violation of national and international norms of indigenous peoples' rights, especially Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). 

In light of these various irregularities, the plaintiffs request, in an injunction, the suspension of the installation license granted by SEMACE as well as the determination that Portocem Energia S.A. refrain from starting the implementation work. On these merits, they request that the licensing process be declared null and void and that a new environmental licensing process be conducted with the presentation of a new EIA that corrects the flaws pointed out and includes prior, free, informed and good faith consultation with the affected indigenous peoples.

A preliminary decision was handed down dismissing the injunction for lack of urgency and probability of the right. However, a decision on the merits is still pending.

Opinion of the National Human Rights Commission on the climate crisis and human rights,"In 2020, forty one South Koreans, including farmers, fishermen, coastal residents, and youth filed a complaint with the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) alleging that their human rights, including the right to life and the right to health, were violated by the climate crisis. The NHRC dismissed the petition, but later commissioned an investigation on the impact of climate change on human rights in July 2021 on its own. In January 2023, the NHRC, for the first time, issued its opinion on the climate crisis and human rights addressed to the President and the Government.

The NHRC opined that the state should recognize the protection and promotion of the human rights of all people in the context of the climate crisis as a fundamental obligation of the state and improve relevant laws and regulations to ensure that the climate crisis is approached from a human rights perspective. Specifically, the NHRC recognized that the individual fundamental rights violated by the climate crisis are virtually all human rights, including the right to life, the right to food, the right to sanitation, the right to health, the right to housing, the right to self-determination, and the right to education.

The NHRC also pointed out that the Framework Act On Carbon Neutrality And Green Growth For Coping With Climate Crisis (Carbon Neutrality Act) does not provide specific support measures for climate-vulnerable groups, and it urged the government to take comprehensive measures to protect climate-vulnerable groups and strengthen their adaptive capacity. According to Article 8 of the Carbon Neutrality Act, the nationally determined contribution (NDC) is to reduce GHG emissions by at least 35% of 2018 emissions by 2030. Article 3 of the Enforcement Decree of the same Act raises the NDC to 40% of 2018 emissions. However, the NHRC noted that even the enhanced NDC falls short of the reduction target set out in the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 (43% of 2019 emissions by 2030). In addition, the Carbon Neutrality Act does not
specify GHG reduction targets beyond 2030, which could lead to intergenerational inequities in GHG reductions. The NHRC required the government to set additional GHG reduction targets. 

Although the opinion of the NHRC does not bind the Government, this decision is the first opinion issued by a governmental body stating that the state bears an obligation to mitigate climate change, and that the current response is insufficient to protect the human rights of its people.",Decided,['South Korea>National Human Right Commission'],['Suits against governments>Human Rights>Right to a healthy environment'],['South Korea>Constitution'],"Whether the government's measures to the climate crisis, including GHG reduction targets, sufficiently protects human rights.",https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/opinion-of-the-national-human-rights-commission-on-the-climate-crisis-and-human-rights/
"Yeon-Tae Kim et al. v. Minister of Land, Infrastructure and Transport","On June 30, 2022, the defendant, the Minister of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport, established a basic plan to construct an airport on a site secured through the reclamation of the Saemangeum tidal flats. The plaintiffs, 1,308 South Korean citizens who oppose the construction of the airport, filed a lawsuit to cancel the basic plan.

For the establishment of the basic plan, a feasibility analysis should prove that airport construction project is viable even if it alters the natural environment. The plaintiffs argued that the pre-feasibility study report had already confirmed that the project would not be economically feasible. The plaintiff claimed that, considering the value of tidal flats as carbon sinks is becoming increasingly important, the reclamation of tidal flats for an unnecessary new airport for aircraftthe most carbon intensive emitter in transportationis also inconsistent with the carbon neutrality policy of the government.

Instituto Internacional Arayara and Fishermen&#039;s Colony Z-5 v. Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. and FEPAM (Mina Guaiba Project and affected communities),"On March 11th, 2020, the NGO Instituto Internacional Arayara and the Fishermen's Colony Z-5 filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) against Copelmi Mineracao Ltda., a mining company, and FEPAM (the state environmental agency). The plaintiffs asked the court to suspend and cancel the environmental permitting process for the Guaiba Mine Project, led by Copelmi, considered the largest open-pit coal project in the country. The project is to be installed in areas inhabited by traditional communities, such as the Z-5 Fishermen's Colony and indigenous territories. It relates to the State Coal Policy and the Carbochemical Pole of Rio Grande do Sul (RS) - created by State Law 15.047/2017which the plaintiffs claim was instituted without popular consultation. They argue that more public hearings for the project were requested by affected communities, but the requests were ignored. In addition, they point out that there was no prior, free and informed consultation with the fishermen of Colony Z-5, a traditional community. They claim that the Environmental Impact Assessment
(EIA/RIMA) for the project has many gaps, since it ignored the area of influence of the Atlantic Forest biome and the rights of the affected communities. They argue the permitting process violated the Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO), the Federal
Constitution and the State Environmental Code of Rio Grande do Sul, and must be declared null as it also contradicts the fight against climate change determined by the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187 / 2009).

In its defense, FEPAM, among other arguments, states that: (i) the plaintiff presents no grounds for the request to suspend the project and affirms the violation of the National Policy on Climate Change without giving further reasoning; (ii) the Judiciary cannot evaluate the
environmental feasibility of the project, especially its compatibility with the National Policy on Climate Change; (iii) the permitting process was regular, since public hearings were held and no obstacle was found to the participation of the fishermen of Colony Z-5, also alleging that the EIA does not need to be exhaustive, being possible to carry out supplementations after the environmental license is granted.

Copelmi also filed a defense, claiming among other points that: (i) the requests for prohibition of the project in relation to the violation of the National Policy on Climate Change lacks a cause of action; (ii) the environmental permitting procedure included public hearings in the
municipalities that make up its area of direct influence, in compliance with environmental regulations; (iii) the issues raised by the plaintiffs were duly analyzed in the EIA/RIMA; (iv) ILO Convention 169 does not apply to artisanal fishermen in the Jacui Delta region, as they do not
qualify as tribal people; and (v) the Guaiba Mine Project will not have a direct impact on fishermen.

Subsequently, there was a decision determining the suspension of this process for six months, considering that the permitting procedure for the Guaiba Mine project was declared null and void in the scope of the case Arayara Association of Education and Culture and others v.
FUNAI, Copelmi Mineracao Ltda. and FEPAM (Mina Guaiba Project and affected indigenous communities).""

Lawyers for Climate Action NZ v. Minister of Climate Change,"The applicant, a climate change NGO, challenged regulations promulgated by the respondent under New Zealands Climate Change Response Act 2002 (the Principal Act). These regulations  the Climate Change (Auction, Limits and Price Control for Units) Amendment Regulations 2022 (the Amendment Regulations)  set unit limits and price controls under New Zealands emissions trading scheme (ETS) for a five-year period (2023-2027). The applicant argued that these regulations were inconsistent with the Principal Act. 

Before the matter went to a full merits hearing, the parties reached agreement on error and relief. The Court ratified that agreement in this decision, finding the Amendment Regulations to be ultra vires the Principal Act, and requiring the Minister to reconsider the unit limit and price control settings (that is, minimum reserve prices, trigger prices for reserve sales, and the amount of reserve domestic units) for the 2023-2027 period.

The Principal Act requires the ETS unit limits and price control settings to be set taking into account New Zealands nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, emissions budgets, and statutory target, as well as a list of matters set out at s 30GC(5)-(6) of the Principal Act. The Amendment Regulations set the price control settings at levels far lower than those projected by New Zealands own Climate Change Commission had recommended as sufficient to meet New Zealands emissions budget and target. 

Although the Minister had originally recommended following the Commissions advice, this recommendation was later revised following a directive from New Zealands Cabinet. Cabinet had deviated from the Commissions settings because of concerns that higher ETS settings could inflate fuel and energy bills. In the course of the litigation, however, the Minister acknowledged that he had erred. Specifically, he accepted that he lacked reasonable grounds toe be satisfied that the Amended Regulations were in accordance with New Zealands 2050 target, emissions budgets, and NDC; and alternatively, that any deviation from these standards could not be justified by other matters prescribed in the Principal Act. Although he argued that such settings were not necessarily inconsistent with these standards, he accepted it was unreasonable to arrive at these settings based on the analysis that he had carried out.

Following agreement between the parties, the Court ordered that the Amendment Regulations be reconsidered to ensure that, as per the Principal Act, they were: (1) in accordance with New Zealands 2050 target; and (2) strictly in accordance with New Zealands emissions budgets and NDC, or alternatively, in accordance with them, with discrepancies justified by matters set out in the Principal Act.

The Friends of Nature Institute v. Ningxia State Grid,"On January 24, 2018, the Friends of Nature Institute (FON) sued the State-owned enterprise, Ningxia State Grid for its high abandonment rate of wind and solar power in violation of Articles 2 and 14 of the Renewable Energy Law. Article 2 provides a definition of ""renewables,"" and Article 14 requires that the grid companies ""purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources"" and ""provide connection service.""

In this case, Ningxia State Grid failed to purchase all electricity generated by wind and solar energy. Based on that, FON claimed that Defendant should (a) purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources within its grids coverage; (b) invest 5% of its annual revenue in renewable energy development for five consecutive years; (c) disclose information related to clean energy consumption; (d) offer a public apology; and (e) bear all of the plaintiffs litigation costs. All of the FONs allegations were denied by Ningxia State Grid.

On April 4, 2023, the Court ruled that Ningxia State Grid did not violate Article 14 of the Renewable Energy Law and dismissed the majority of the FONs claims. The Court first confirmed that the State Grid has the general obligation to protect the environment in accordance with the law, regulation, and business standards. However, the Court found that the defendant has met its specific obligation in purchasing wind and solar power. According to the Measures for the Guaranteed Full Purchase of Renewable Electric Power issued by the National Development and Reform
Commission on March 24, 2016, grid companies are required to ""purchase all electricity"" under Article 14 only if the electricity consumption is safe. Ningxia State Grid has met its renewable energy consumption target, which was confirmed by The Reply Letter Related to FON v. Ningxia State Grid from the Development and Reform Commission of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on April 1, 2021. Meanwhile, the Court understood that the enterprise must continue to use coal-fired electricity to assure grid stability because the production of wind and photovoltaic energy is characterized by randomness, intermittency, and volatility. In addition, the Court observed that renewable resources are primarily concentrated in the western region of the country, geographically distant from the power load center situated in the eastern part. Consequently, achieving complete local utilization of these resources poses a significant challenge.

However, the Court also stressed that the State Grid still has social responsibility for facilitating the use of the renewables and shall effectively implement its low-carbon transition plans under the scrutiny of responsible governmental agencies. Also, the Court affirmed FONs active participation in environmental litigation. In light of the public interest character of the plaintiff's lawsuit and the defendants social responsibility, the court ordered Ningxia State Grid to cover 350,000 RMB (49,000 USD) of the plaintiffs litigation costs.

"Federal Environmental Agency (IBAMA) vs. Alto Norte Industria, Comercio e Exportacao de  Madeiras Ltda","On 20th December 2018, Brazils Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA), filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against Alto Norte Industria, Comercio e Exportacao de Madeiras Ltda. seeking compensation for environmental and climate damages based on an infringement notice for illegal wood storage without an environmental license. This public civil action is part of a set of 9 lawsuits brought by IBAMA on the same grounds, but against different defendants, to question illegal wood deposits and climate damage. The plaintiff alleges that the storage of wood without proven origin is associated with illegal deforestation and predatory exploitation in the Amazon biome. Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, and (iii) contribution to global warming. As for the climate damage, it claims that the unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere.

The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 20.63 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,003,342.17. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 7,571.21
tons of carbon.

The plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant&#39;s conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.

In a preliminary decision, the court partially granted the injunction, considering that the danger of delay was evident, especially in view of the fragility of the ecologically balanced environment. Thus, it granted and ordered (i) the suspension of the right to participate in financing lines offered by official credit establishments; (ii) the restriction of access to tax incentives and tax benefits offered by the Government in the three spheres of the Federation; and (iii) the unavailability of the assets of Alto Norte Industria, Comercio e Exportacao de Madeiras Ltda. in the amount of R$ 2,224,949.63.",Pending,['Brazil>Mato Grosso'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage']","['Brazil>National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 5', 'Brazil>National Climate Change Policy (Law No. 12187 of 2009)']",The quantification of the climate and environment damage in the civil liability for the illegal wood storage.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-environmental-agency-ibama-vs-alto-norte-industria-comercio-e-exportacao-de-madeiras-ltda/
Ministry of Environment and Forestry v. PT Kalimantan Lestari Mandiri,"On December 31st, 2018, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MoEF) sued a palm oil plantation for fires occurring inside the PT Kalimantan Lestari Mandiri concessions. The MoEF claimed that the defendant intentionally burned the land to clear and use it as the new crop field for palm oil. The plaintiff also claimed that the defendant infringed various obligations to prevent and control fires within the concession. The plaintiff mentioned that strict liability is the basis for defendants liability. The MoEF asked the court to declare the defendant liable for the damages and restoration costs for fires.

Due to fires inside the defendants-controlled area, the MoEF then sought compensation of IDR 337.365.000 for carbon release and IDR 118.078.00 for the loss of carbon sinks.

On May 8th, 2019, the District Court of Kuala Kapuas ruled that the defendant liable for damages caused by fires. The judges also granted the plaintiff request for the restoration and damages costs.

PT Waringin Agro Jaya,"On July 7th, 2016, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MoEF) sued a company of palm oil plantation, namely PT Waringin Agro Jaya, for fires covering an area of 1,626 hectares. The MoEF used two liability rules in this lawsuit: strict liability and the unlawful act rule (Perbuatan Melawan Hukum). For the unlawful act rule, the plaintiff argued that the defendant had intentionally set up fires to clear the land for the sake of efficiency. For the strict liability rule, the plaintiff argued that the defendants activities posed significant threats to environmentconsidering the crop field are within the peatlands area. Therefore, the defendant would be liable for compensation of damages caused by wildfires within concessions area. 

The MoEF ask the court to order the defendant to pay compensation of IDR 988 million for the released of 10,979 tC and IDR 345.8 million for the losses of carbon sinks which equals to 3,843 tC. On February 7th, 2017, the district court of South Jakarta ruled in favor of the plaintiff and held the defendant strictly liable for compensation of IDR 173.4 billion.

PT National Sago Prima,"On February 5th, 2016, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry (the MoEF) sued a sago plantation company, namely PT National Sago Prima, for fires occurring inside its controlled area. The MoEF claimed that the defendant infringed upon various obligations under Indonesian environmental regulation. Firstly, the MoEF argued that the defendant did not have adequate preventive and control system as required in Indonesian forest protection regulation. Secondly, the MoEF found that PT National Sago Prima were running the business without the mandatory Environmental Impact Analysis (Analisis Mengenai Dampak Lingkungan). Hence, the MoEF argued that the defendant had been negligent and therefore is liable for compensation for the damages. The MoEF asked the court to order the defendant to pay IDR 2,430,000,000 for the release of 27.000 tC and IDR 850,500,000 for the losses of carbon sinks.

Federal Public Prosecutors Office (MPF) v. Brazil and others (Sea advance and coastal erosion),"On January 29, 2014 the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (Ministerio Publico Federal  MPF) filed a Public Civil Action (environmental class-action) with a request for an injunction against the Federal Union, IBAMA (Federal Environmental Agency), State of Sergipe, Sergipes Environmental Agency and others, including private individuals alleging environmental damage. The damage is alleged to have occurred due to the irregular occupation of an area of Boa Viagem Beach in Sergipe. The area in question is a sandbank environment, with dunes and mangrove vegetation, constituting a permanent preservation area, and has bars and summer houses built irregularly. The plaintiff affirms that there has been invasion of federal public property, illegal landfilling and sewage disposal directly into the ground, in drains, contaminating the water table and impairing public access to the beach. All the constructions were irregular and made in a way that violated several protective norms.

There was a ruling of the injunction that ordered the interdiction of the bars on the site, considering, as a supervening fact, the advance of tides on the locality, which eroded the foundations of the establishments and put them at risk of collapse. 

Two defendants who had their bars interdicted filed several appeals in succession until one of those appeals was analyzed by the Superior Court of Justice (STJ). The admission of the last appeal (Interlocutory Appeal in the Special Appeal) was dismissed. The ruling highlighted the undeniable consequences of climate change that already affect everyone, but especially the poorest. The impacts on this vulnerable group in particular were emphasized. Within this scenario, it was highlighted that the attention of judges is necessary to ensure the values of the Environmental Rule of Law. The ruling stated that, in this case, within the scenario of climate change, the advance of the tides and the 
consequent destruction of bars and restaurants located on their shores is foreseeable.",Pending,"['Brazil>Sergipe Federal Court', 'Brazil>Curitiba>Federal District Court of Curitiba', 'Brazil>Superior Court of Justice']","['Suits against corporations, individuals>Others', 'Suits against governments>Environmental assessment and permitting']",[],Whether buildings can be interdicted by the public authorities due to the advance of the tides caused by climate change.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/federal-public-prosecutors-office-mpf-v-brazil-and-others-sea-advance-and-coastal-erosion/
Citizens and NGOs v. Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and Ministry of Mines and Energy,"On May 9, 2023, a group of six citizens and three NGOs (Colectivo de Abogados Jose Alvear Restrepo, Censat Agua Viva and Polen Transiciones Justas) filed a lawsuit before the Adminsitrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca (the Tribunal) seeking the declaration of non- compliance by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and the Ministry of Mines and Energy of their obligations under Law 1931 of 2018 (art. 2 num. 7 and 8; art. 7 num. 1, 2, 3 and 5; art. 17, art. 18 and art. 31) and Law 2169 of 2021 (art. 6 num. 17; art. 13; art. 16).

On one hand, the 2018 climate action law, as it is also known, establishes guidelines for climate action in Colombia. The statutes main goals are to put forth climate change adaptation measures, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce the populations and ecosystems vulnerabilities and promote a just transition towards decarbonization. On the other, Law 2169 of 2021 establishes a baseline of minimum goals and measures of carbon neutrality and climate resilience with the aim of promoting a development low in carbon emissions.

Plaintiffs argue that both ministries have failed to promote the inclusion of climate and environmental-related impacts in management, development, planning and monitoring instruments of coal exploitation, extraction, transportation and burning, particularly large-scale mining projects. Similarly, ministries have failed to adopt the necessary measures to prevent risks generated by coal exploitation and to monitor the implementation of action programs, particularly those related to climate change action. Plaintiffs assert that there is a general lack of standards and compliance indexes that would allow to evaluate the efficacy of the measures taken by the government. They claim that the government has failed to gather crucial information regarding the increase of climate vulnerability and the quantification of emissions derived from the coal supply chain.

On July 6, 2023, the Tribunal decided to partially accept the plaintiffs claims. The Tribunal found that article 2 of Law 1931 of 2018 was outside the lawsuits scope, given that this article includes guiding principles and does not establish a concrete obligation or mandate susceptible of compliance. Moreover, the Tribunal found sufficient evidence that the Ministry of Mining and Energy had indeed complied with its obligations under articles 7 (num. 1 and 3) of Law 1931 of 2018, related to the creation of guidelines to ensure compliance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals, as well as monitoring, within its functions, the development programs related to climate action. Finally, the Tribunal confirmed that the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development had complied with article 7 (num. 5), that concerns with updating the inventory of GHG and informing its progress.

However, the Tribunal declared the non-compliance by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of article 7 (num. 2 and 3), article 17 and article 31 of Law 1931 of 2018, as well as article 6 (num. 17), article 13 and article 16 of Law 2169 of 2021. As per the Ministry of Mining and Energy, the Tribunal declared the non-compliance of article 7 (num. 5). These articles refer to mechanisms and studies that were meant to be implemented since the issuance of the laws and have yet to be formulated, adopted and implemented, particularly those concerned with coal exploitation and supply chain. In particular, the Tribunal ordered the: (i) identification of climate impacts within the Environmental Impact Assessments of mining projects; (ii) information gathering to update GHG inventory by the Ministry of Mining and Energy; (iii) implementation and monitoring of climate action plans; (iv) creation of more specific control and monitoring processes to verify GHG emissions and its reductions; (v) inclusion in climate action plans of specific goals and measures to mitigate climate change; and (vi) mandatory report of GHG by public and private parties. The tribunal imposed a six-month deadline and ordered the defendants to submit monthly reports of the actions taken to comply.

Lastly, arguments against article 18 were dismissed due to res judicata, according to the precedent set in Office of the Inspector General and Others v. Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development and Others.

On July 13, 2023, both the plaintiffs and the defendants filed appeals.

The plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.

In its response, the defendant preliminarily alleged passive illegitimacy due to lack of evidence relating the defendant to the deforestation and the ineptitude of the initial petition. He also claimed the absence of liability for lack of evidence that the defendant was to blame for the damage, in addition to not having any interference over the area where the alleged deforestation was carried out.

Subsequently, a judgment was delivered upholding the claims. The defendant's arguments were refuted and it was affirmed that the infraction notice was coated with the requirements of validity and delineates the environmental damage. The allegation of passive illegitimacy was also refuted, stating that, in the environmental field, civil liability of a purely objective nature prevails. Thus, the defendant was condemned (i) to make an obligation to recover the area, and to prepare and comply with a reforestation project for the deforested area, under penalty of a fine, and (ii) to pay compensation for property damage, in case of impossibility of recovering the degraded area, in an amount to be defined in the settlement phase, by arbitration.

In view of the sentence, IBAMA filed a motion for clarification requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay the amount of R$ 1,447,650.20 related to the social cost of carbon, on which the sentence did not rule.

Subsequently, an integrative judgment was issued in which the court remedied the omission of the previous decision by including in the conviction the obligation to pay for the social cost of carbon.",Pending,['Brazil>Amapa Federal Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Climate damage']","['Brazil>National Environmental Policy (Federal Law 6 938/81)', 'Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 225']","The quantification of the climate and environment damage in the civil liability for the illegal wood storage.

Federal Environmental Agency (IBAMA) v. Silmar Gomes Moreira,"On December 2018, Brazils Federal Environment Agency (IBAMA), filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against Silmar Gomes Moreira seeking compensation for environmental and climate damages based on an infringement notice for illegal wood storage without an environmental license. 

This public civil action is part of a set of 9 lawsuits brought by IBAMA on the same grounds, but against different defendants, to question illegal wood deposit and climate damage. 

The plaintiff alleges that the storage of wood without proven origin is associated with illegal deforestation and predatory exploitation in the Amazon biome. Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, (iii) contribution to global warming. As for the climate damage, it claims that the unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 

The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 20.6365 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,003,973.37. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 7,573,5955 tons of carbon.

The plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.

In a preliminary decision, the court rejected the injunction, considering that there was no urgency of the provision or danger of delay.

The defendant filed a defense arguing that the initial complaint showed no evidence relating the facts to the alleged environmental damage. He affirmed the insignificance of the deforestation caused, which, in his words, only had occurred to ensure the survival of his family. Silmar Gomes also stated the irrelevant extension of the area deforested when compared to the total area preserved. On the merits, he questioned the infraction notice that supports the complaint, stating that it would be fairer to apply a milder penalty of recomposition of the vegetation cover. He claimed that the infraction notice issued by IBAMA would be illegal and that the right to an adversarial proceeding and a broad defense would have been violated; in addition to abuse of the inspectors involved. It claimed the absence of the elements necessary to characterize strict liability, alleging the absence of specific and consequential environmental damage (to fauna, flora, soil erosion and global warming). Finally, it asserted that the preliminary injunctions and the reversal of the burden of proof were not appropriate.

The plaintiff,  IBAMA, submitted a reply challenging the points raised by the opposition, and attached Technical Information No. 10/2019-COREC/CGBIO/DBFLO, which explains how the calculation is made to arrive at the amount of compensation sought in relation to the application of the Social Cost of Carbon (CSC).

A judgment was issued partially upholding the claims. The defendant's arguments were refuted and it was stated that the notice of violation was covered by the requirements of validity. It was held that both the environmental damage and the causal link necessary for liability were demonstrated in the document. Thus, it condemned the defendant in the obligation to establish the recovery in natura, and must elaborate and fulfill a reforestation project of the deforested area, under penalty of a fine. It was also determined the unavailability of the defendant's assets to ensure compliance with the sentence, and the suspension of credit, incentives and tax benefits granted by the Public Power, until the full repair of the damage is proven. However, the request regarding the obligation to pay for climate damage was not accepted. The court held that the payment based on the CSC was not a feasible obligation, stating that there was no delimitation due to lack of expert evidence.

Subsequently, IBAMA filed an appeal, reiterating the argument of the need for compensation based on the CSC. It asserted that the initial petition indicated and demonstrated the probable amount of GHG emissions that the suppression carried out by the defendant caused, as well as indicated pecuniary values for its due compensation. It stated that the values presented are estimates of reasonable accuracy based on scientific data. The judgment, however, despite having condemned the defendant for the damage and to restore the area, denied the request regarding the payment of climate damage. The appellant also emphasized that, since the damage is certain and proven, it cannot be allowed to go unrepaired, and the sentence should be reformed in this regard. The appealed party, Silmar Gomes, filed counter-appeals defending the maintenance of the sentence and the appeal is still pending.

The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 29.57 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,871,48947. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 10,852.19 tons of carbon.

The plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.

In a preliminary decision, the court partially granted the injunction, considering that the danger of delay was evident, especially in view of the fragility of the ecologically balanced environment. Thus, it granted and ordered (i) the suspension of the right to participate in financing lines offered by official credit establishments and (ii) the restriction of access to tax incentives and tax benefits offered by the Government in the three spheres of the Federation. However, the Federal Judge stated that, for the time being, the use of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) for the purposes of decreeing the unavailability of assets was not feasible due to the lack of technical subsidies, and that the amount requested was, at first glance, disproportionate.

IBAMA then filed an interlocutory appeal (AI 1004508-40.2019.4.01.0000) requesting the inclusion of the amount related to the CSC in the declaration of unavailability of assets, considering the soundness of the methodology used as a reference for its quantification. It argues that in order to fully recover the environmental damage caused, it is necessary to include the social cost of carbon, which appears as ""residual damage"" or ""permanent damage"".

A first conciliation hearing was held in which the parties expressed interest in formalizing an agreement, although they did not have a proposal ready.

In response, the defendant alleged a violation of the principle of due process of law in the administrative proceeding to determine the environmental violation and the absence of a causal link for imputation of liability. In addition, it argued that the use of the social cost of carbon for the purpose of quantifying the damage implies unjust enrichment since the extraction of forest products is a conduct unrelated to its business activity.

A new hearing was held with the presentation of a settlement proposal by the defendant. IBAMA disagreed with the settlement offer because it only contemplated the obligation to indemnify the environmental damage, with no mention of the need to restore the degraded area, and requested the proposal to be complemented.

It affirms the need for reversal of the burden of proof and, definitively, requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do, to restore an area equivalent to that deforested, and obligation to pay, in the amount related to the social cost of carbon. 
In a preliminary decision, the court rejected the injunction, considering that  there was no urgency of the provision or danger in delay. 
The defendant filed a reply to the indictment stating that the initial claim for compensation for environmental damages was inaccurate, arguing that the liability has not been proven and questioning the amount of the calculated damage. It also claimed that the environmental agents had gotten the quantity of timber stored wrong and , therefore, that the defendant did not have illegal wood deposit. It also questioned the methodology used by IBAMA to calculate the environmental damage based on the Social Cost of Carbon, stating that there was no possibility of really individualizing the alleged damage. Finally, it requested the dismissal of the case without resolution on the merits or the judgment on merits rejecting the complaint.

The court ruled the claim in advance, partially accepting the initial petition requests. The Federal Judge understood that the materiality and authorship of the environmental offense had been proven by the work of IBAMA agents - inspection report and photographic report presented. It considered that the defendant's conduct caused damage to the community, including loss of soil nutrients, effects on the local population, loss of natural capital, increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and decrease of water availability, accepting the request for condemnation to pay for the social cost of carbon. He argued that the amount to be paid should be fixed based on the severity of the damage, the degree of guilt of the offender and the socioeconomic size of the defendant. Thus, he understood that the damage in question is relevant and that the defendant has a high degree of guilt.

As for the climate damage, it claims that the unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere. 

The plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 20.63 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 2,003,342.17. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 7,571.21 tons of carbon.

The plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.

In a preliminary decision, the court partially granted the injunction, considering that the danger of delay was evident, especially in view of the fragility of the ecologically balanced environment. Thus, it granted and ordered (i) the suspension of the right to participate in financing lines offered by official credit establishments; (ii) the restriction of access to tax incentives and tax benefits offered by the Government in the three spheres of the Federation; (iii) the unavailability of the assets of Alto Norte Industria, Comercio e Exportacao de Madeiras Ltda. in the amount of R$ 2,224,949.63.

SFOC et al. v. Minister of Health and Welfare,"Plaintiffs are three environmental organizations, Solutions for Our Climate, Green Environment Youth Korea, and 60+ Climate Action. Defendant is the Minister of Health and Welfare of the Korean Government, who also chairs the Fund Management Committee of the National Pension Service. Plaintiffs are seeking an order against the Defendant to disclose the record in relation to the coal divestment policy discussions in the National Pension Service.

National Pension Service is one of the largest asset owners in the world, managing more than USD 800B. In May 2021, National Pension Service announced that it will no longer invest in coal mining and coal power generation, and that it will prepare a policy setting out the details of the coal policy by 2022. However, after two years of the announcement, National Pension Service has not published its coal policy and has refused to disclose any information on the ongoing discussions.

Prior to the filing of the complaint, Plaintiffs submitted a request for disclosure of information to the National Pension Service in accordance with the applicable provision of the Act on Disclosure of Information for Public Institutions on 24 May 2023. However, the National Pension refused to comply with most of the requests, particularly the minutes of the Fund Management Committee dealing with the coal policy on the basis that such information could adversely affect the fair management of the fund or the stability of the financial market, which constitutes a ground for refusal under the same Act.

Plaintiffs challenge the National Pension Services refusal by filing a disclosure of information claim in the Seoul District Court, arguing that the requested information does not fall into the exception category argued by the National Pension Service, and therefore must be made publicly available.",Pending,['South Korea>Seoul District Court'],['Suits against governments'],['South Korea>Act on Disclosure of Information for Public Institutions'],Whether the information related to the National Pension Services internal discussions on introduction of coal investment policy is required to be disclosed under the Act on Disclosure of Information for Public Institutions.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/sfoc-et-al-v-minister-of-health-and-welfare/
ADI 7146 (Regime of environmental protected areas in urban areas),"On 18th of April, 2022, four political parties, Workers Party (PT), Brazilian Socialist Party (PSB), Socialism and Freedom Party (PSOL) and Rede Sustentabilidade (Rede) filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI), with a request for a precautionary measure, seeking the declaration of unconstitutionality of Federal Law 14.285/2021, which amends the environmental protection regime of urban protected areas (APPs), conferring on the Municipalities and the Federal District the competence to define the limits of APPs around watercourses in urban areas, regardless of the limits established by Federal Law 12.651/2012 (Forest Code). The plaintiffs argue that the challenged law is materially unconstitutional, as it violates (i) the constitutional regime of distribution of competences in environmental matters (articles 24, VI, VII and VIII c/c 30, II), (ii) the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment (article 225) and (iii) the duty of the public authorities to protect the environment (articles 225 and 23, VI and VII), provided for in the Federal Constitution, as well as the principles of prevention and precaution, the prohibition of regression in environmental matters and the prohibition of insufficient protection. They argue that the law represents a relaxation of the protection of urban APPs which, in turn, impacts the management of environmental risks and disasters (such as floods and landslides), increasingly frequent with the intensification of extreme events associated with climate change. They request, as a precautionary measure, the suspension of the effects of Federal Law 14.285/2021 until the end of the judgment of the action, maintaining the applicability of the previous law. On the merits, they request the declaration of unconstitutionality of the law.

AMOREMA e AMORETGRAP vs. Sustainable Carbon and others (Carbon credits and Extractive Reserves),"On December 20, 2021, AMOREMA and AMORETGRAP filed a Public Civil Action (ACP) against Sustainable Carbon - Projetos Ambientais Ltda., Ecomapua Conservacao Ltda., Eccaplan Consultoria em Sustentabilidade, Bio Assets Ativos Ambientais Ltda, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Consultores Ltda., Barilla G. e R. F.lli S.P.A., Banco Santander S.A., ISA CTEEP - Companhia de Transmissao de Energia Eletrica Paulista, Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu Auditores Independentes, BB MAPFRE Participacoes S.A., IATA International Air Transport Association, Swire Pacific Offshore Operations (PTE.) Ltd, Inter-American Development Bank, Companhia de Locacao das Americas, Groupe Air France, 17er Oberlandenergie GMBH, Wienerberger GMBH, Brockhaus Stahl GMBH and other companies which acquired carbon credits from the Ecomapua Project that could not be identified by the plaintiffs. It is alleged that the defendant companies illicitly traded in the voluntary market carbon credits generated in or around the Mapua Extractive Reserve (RESEX Mapua) and Terra Grande-Pracuuba Extractive Reserve (RESEX Terra Grande-Pracuuba), located in the Amazon, in the state of Para, which characterizes illegal takeover of these assets.

This is because the defendant companies obtain an economic advantage from the misappropriation of credits, due to the environmental preservation promoted by the traditional extractivist population, without receiving fair remuneration or compensation. The Extractive Reserves are, according to specific legislation, public lands of the Federal Union, whose real right of use is granted to the traditional populations that inhabit them. It is in discussion the generation and sale of carbon credits from ""Ecomapua Project"" from 2015 in the Amazon, prepared and/or marketed by the companies Ecomapua, Sustainable Carbon, Bio Assets and Evento Neutro, which consists of the sale of assets from REDD+ projects (credits generated by avoided deforestation, sustainable management and increased forest carbon stocks), is discussed. The other defendant companies are sued for having acquired the assets without the necessary diligence, therefore entering into void contracts due to illicit objects, or for being supporters of the project. It is claimed that areas of the Project, consisting of Fazendas Brasileiro, Lago do Jacare and Sao Domingos, overlap with the territory of RESEX Mapua and Terra Grande-Pracuuba, where hundreds of families live and, therefore, the certified credits from these areas should belong to the extractivist communities that inhabit them.

It is argued that the preservation of forests in the project areas comes from the activities of the extractivist communities in the region and that the sale of the assets of the Ecomapua Project had the certification of ""social carbon,"" stating that there would be counterparts for the communities, which did not occur. Thus, the plaintiffs claim that the companies misused the name, image, and cultural heritage of the communities and altered the truth of the facts by advertising the socio-environmental responsibility of the Project. The associations argue that the companies caused collective material and moral damages to the extractivist families and incurred in enrichment by intervention. They request: (i) that the defendants which sold carbon credits submit detailed reports on said assets; (ii) that the defendants submit contracts and other documents on the transactions carried out within the scope of the Ecomapua Project; (iii) the joint and several condemnation of the defendants to pay the plaintiffs compensation for material damages, restitution of the benefits earned by the defendants and compensation for collective moral damage; and (iv) order, under penalty of a fine, that the defendants cease to buy or sell carbon credits from within or around the Mapua and Terra Grande-Pracuuba Extractive Reserves and cease to use the name and image of the extractivist populations, their associations and the respective Extractive Reserves.",Pending,['Brazil>Para Federal Court'],"['Suits against corporations, individuals>Corporations>Carbon credits']","['Brazil>Federal Constitution>art. 216', 'Brazil>Federal Law 9 985/2000 (National System of Nature Conservation Units  SNUC)', 'Brazil>ILO Convention 169 (enacted by Decree 5051/2004']",Whether the defendant companies illicitly traded in the voluntary market carbon credits generated in or around Extractive Reserves located in the Amazon characterizing a kind of illegal takeover of these assets.,https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/amorema-e-amoretgrap-vs-sustainable-carbon-and-others-carbon-credits-and-extractive-reserves/
In Re Tax Benefits for Aviation,"In a decision of 30 September 2020, the Constitutional Court held that climate-damaging tax benefits for aviation companies cannot be contested by persons who do not use the services of these companies for environmental reasons. The corresponding application thus was inadmissible (see http://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-austria/). On 23 February 2022, a previously uninvolved applicant  a consumer using both rail and air services  resubmitted the application. The applicant has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and suffers from the related Uthoff syndrome  symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbate in case of higher temperatures. At temperatures of 25C, the applicants ability to walk is limited; at temperatures of 30C, the applicant depends on a wheelchair and assistance from others. As a result of climate change, the number of warm and hot days in Austria steadily increased; the average temperature in Austria has already risen by 1.8C (compared to the global average of 1C). Thus, Austria is particularly affected by the climate crisis. Nevertheless, it further aggravates the climate crisis: Austrian tax law provides that the domestic part of cross-border passenger transportation by aviation companies is exempt from the turnover tax. Furthermore, paraffin  the fuel for air travel  is exempt from the mineral oil tax. On the other hand, passenger transportation by rail companies is not exempt from the turnover tax even though greenhouse gas emissions associated with a rail journey are, on average, 31 times lower than when traveling the same distance by airplane. 

Against this background, the applicant alleged the unconstitutionality of relevant tax provisions in the Federal Turnover Tax Act and the Mineral Oil Tax Act for violating her fundamental rights. In concrete terms, the applicant alleged a violation of her right to equality before the law, her right to life and her right to private and family life. 
The right to equality before the law conveys a right to equal treatment  differentiations are only justified when they result from differences in facts. According to the applicant, trains and airplanes are  at least in Europe and Austria, where the high-speed rail network is well developed  equivalent means of transport as total travel time is similar. Differences only occur with regard to associated emissions which are drastically higher when traveling per plane. Tax benefits for aviation thus lead to unequal treatment of equivalent means of transport that stand in direct competition. As a result of tax benefits for aviation, end consumers that travel by rail have to pay 10% more for their tickets for an identical route at an identical price per kilometer than if they were to fly. This unequal treatment is not objectively justified. It contradicts Austrias obligations under international and European law to mitigate the climate crisis, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting climate-damaging behavior. Therefore, the applicant asserted a violation of her right to equality before the law. 

The applicant further alleged a violation of her right to life. The right to life, as enshrined in Art 2 ECHR and Art 2 CFR, entails positive obligations  the state must adopt measures that prevent (foreseeable) threats to life. Climate change threatens human life directly and indirectly, for example, by destroying ecosystems. The Austrian state, thus, is under a positive obligation to adopt measures to prevent threats to life from climate change. However, the state not only disregards this obligation but also encourages climate-damaging behavior by granting tax benefits to aviation. Due to the lack of justification, the applicant asserts a violation of her right to life. 
Positive obligations also arise from the right to respect for private and family life according to Art 8 ECHR and Art 7 CFR. The Austrian state is obliged to protect health, physical and mental well-being and bodily integrity from environmental hazards, including climate change. Climate change leads to an increased occurrence of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods or hurricanes, which negatively impact human health. This is particularly evident in the case of the applicant who, due to the increasing number of warm and hot days caused by climate change, is more frequently dependent on a wheelchair and assistance or forced to live isolated in cooled indoor areas. The applicant thus alleged that the Austrian state violates its positive obligations under Art 8 ECHR and Art 7 CFR by promoting climate damaging behavior through tax benefits.

The applicants demanded that the Constitutional Court repeals the relevant provisions of the Federal Turnover Tax Act and the Mineral Oil Tax Act as unconstitutional. In addition, she asked the Constitutional Court to initiate preliminary ruling proceedings at the European Court of Justice to clarify whether Art 37 CFR constitutes a fundamental right, a principle or a European objective.   

On 27 June 2023, the Constitutional Court dismissed the application as inadmissible. As of 1 January 2023, the Turnover Tax Act had been amended to exempt not only aviation but also cross-border rail transport from the turnover tax. The applicants lacked standing since the originally contested provision was no longer in force. The court further held that the obligation to pay turnover taxes was directed at businesses and that consumers were, therefore, excluded from challenging respective provisions. The same applies in connection with the mineral oil tax: since it is not payable by consumers, they are not affected in their legal sphere and thus are not entitled to challenge tax provisions.

In re Federal Climate Protection Act Austria,"In 2023, the applicant filed a complaint with the Austrian Constitutional Court and alleged that Art 3 of the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz) was unconstitutional for not ensuring Austrias compliance with international and European greenhouse gas reduction obligations, thereby violating fundamental rights. 
The Federal Climate Protection Act was adopted in 2011 to implement emission reduction obligations under international and European Law. According to Art 3 para 1 of the Act, the maximum permissible GHG emissions shall be defined in the annexes to the Act and distributed among sectors. The annexes accordingly provide for maximum GHG emissions for 2008-2012 and 2013-2020; the Act does not stipulate any emission reduction targets after 2020. In addition, Art 3 para 2 Federal Climate Protection Act provides a (mere) negotiation obligation regarding measures that ensure compliance with maximum GHG emissions. Also, the Act does not contain a sanction mechanism. 

The applicant brought forward that Art 3 Federal Climate Protection Act leads to a shifting of the GHG reduction burden to the future and hinders compliance with international and European emission reduction obligations until 2030. To comply with international and European GHG reduction obligations, Austria would have to adopt drastic measures in the near future. These measures would infringe on fundamental rights as many areas of life and personal freedom are inextricably linked to the emission of greenhouse gases. The applicant accordingly asserted a violation of the right to property, the freedom of occupation, and the right to respect for private and family life. In addition, the applicant suggested that the challenged provision was disproportionate for not ensuring compliance with international and European law and, therefore, infringed on the right to equality before the law. 

On 27 June 2023, the Constitutional Court rejected the application. The Court held that it was not evident from the application which of the future measures mentioned by the applicant would interfere with which fundamental rights positions. Contrary to procedural provisions, the alleged unconstitutionality was not explained in detail. Hence, the application was inadmissible.

Jubilee v EFA and NAIF,"On 18 July 2023, Jubilee Australia, a human rights and environmental organisation, filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia seeking to compel Federal government agencies that subsidise fossil fuel projects to disclose the full environmental effects of those activities. 

The claim is against Export Finance Australia (EFA) which is Australias export credit agency, and the Northern Australia Infrastructure Facility (NAIF), a $7bn AUD fund for infrastructure in northern Australia. 

Both EFA and NAIF provide taxpayer subsidised financial support to fossil fuel projects that may not otherwise go ahead. 

The claim names the Chairs of EFA and NAIF as representatives of their respective Boards which, in turn, must ensure the reporting requirements are met. 

The action alleges certain contraventions of s 516A(6) of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) that requires government agencies and departments to include the following information in their annual reports: 

1.	How their activities accord with the principles of ecologically sustainable development  including the precautionary principle and the principle of intergenerational equity; 
2.	The effect of their activities on the environment; 
3.	The measures they are taking to minimise the impact of their activities on the environment;
4.	The mechanisms for reviewing and increasing the effectiveness of measures to minimise the impact of the activities on the environment.

The definition of activities includes developing and implementing policies, plans, programs and legislation. 

Jubilee Australia alleges that EFA and NAIF fail to adequately disclose the information above in recent annual reports, including failing to disclose the true effect of their financing activities on the environment. 

On 9 August 2023, the Court made orders setting out a timetable for the respondents to request further and better particulars of the statement of claim.

ASIC v Vanguard Investments Australia Ltd,"On 24 July 2023, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) commenced proceedings against Vanguard Investments Australia Ltd (Vanguard) alleging misleading conduct in relation to the ESG criteria applied to its Vanguard Ethically Conscious Global Aggregate Bond Index (Hedged) Fund (the Fund). 

The Fund tracks an index called the Bloomberg Barclays MSCI Global Aggregate SRI Exclusions Float Adjusted Index (the Index), which purports to exclude securities based on research and screening against ESG criteria. 

Between August 2018 and February 2021, Vanguard published twelve product disclosure statements (PDSs) for the Fund, each of which contained a statement that Vanguard does not take into account labour standards, environment, social or ethical considerations when selecting, retaining or realising investments in the Fund to track the performance of the benchmark index, but that Vanguard has engaged Bloomberg Barclays to provide an index of securities for the Fund that excludes companies with significant business activities involving fossil fuels, alcohol, tobacco, gambling, military weapons and civilian firearms, nuclear power and adult entertainment.

A majority of the PDSs also directed readers to Bloombergs website which contained fact sheets about the index. A fact sheet issued in 2018 stated that the Index removes issuers with evidence of owning fossil fuel reserves or are involved in certain controversial business lines. A fact sheet issued in 2020 stated that the index removes issuers with ties to thermal coal, oil and gas or are involved in certain controversial business lines. The index also excludes issuers with very severe ESG Controversies or Red Flags.

Vanguard also allegedly made similar statements about the ESG screening of the Fund in an interview during the relevant time period. 

ASIC is ultimately alleging that Vanguard made representations that:

1.	Before being included in the Index, and the Fund, securities were screened to assess their applicability against certain ESG criteria; and 
2.	Securities that did not meet the ESG criteria were excluded from their inclusion in the Index, and therefore the Fund. 

ASIC alleges that contrary to these representations, a significant proportion of the bonds in the Index and therefore the Fund were not screened against the applicable ESG criteria. 

ASIC seeks declarations that Vanguard has engaged in misleading conduct, an order that Vanguard pay pecuniary penalties in respect of that conduct and adverse publicity orders. 

The matter is listed for a first case management hearing on 25 August 2023.

Australian Parents for Climate Action v EnergyAustralia,"On 9 August 2023, Australian Parents for Climate Action (AP4CA) filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia challenging allegedly misleading statements made by EnergyAustralia about its carbon neutral energy products. 

AP4CA is a climate advocacy organisation that works for parents, carers and families who want to create a safer future for their children. 

EnergyAustralia produces and sells electricity and is Australias third largest domestic greenhouse gas emitter, producing 16.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2021/22. EnergyAustralia offers Go Neutral Electricity and Go Neutral Gas products. Go Neutral customers purchase energy which is mainly sourced from burning fossil fuels and EnergyAustralia promises to purchase carbon credits to offset the associated emissions. 

The Go Neutral products require consumers to opt-in but there is no additional cost to the consumer. 

EnergyAustralia on its website claims that: 

1.	Go Neutral electricity and gas is carbon neutral;
2.	Emissions created by Go Neutral electricity and gas are cancelled out or negated; 
3.	By opting into Go Neutral products, consumers have a positive impact on the environment. 

AP4CA argues that EnergyAustralias marketing of its Go Neutral products amounts to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law. 

AP4CA argues that carbon offsets do not cancel out or neutralise the emissions generation by Go Neutral energy, and that using Go Neutral energy does not have a positive impact on the environment. This is because, in summary: 

1.	Paying someone else to avoid generating emissions (known as an avoidance credit) is not equivalent to removing the emissions generated from Go Neutral energy. Almost 99% of EnergyAustralias carbon credits are avoidance credits;
2.	Paying someone else to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere (known as a removal credit) does not cancel out or negate the emissions generated from Go Neutral energy. The carbon removal projects EnergyAustralia buys are short-lived and not permanent; 
3.	The emissions from Go Neutral ultimately result in a net increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. 

AP4CA also argues that EnergyAustralias renewable energy product PureEnergy was not given the same prominence on its website as Go Neutral, meaning customers could not compare both products. 

AP4CA seeks a declaration that EnergyAustralia has misled its customers since 2019 about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their electricity and gas usage. 

AP4CA also seeks an order that EnergyAustralia be restrained from making carbon neutral or similar statements to describe the Go Neutral product, and that it issue a corrective statement to its customers.

Nuestros Derechos al Futuro y Medio Ambiente Sano and CEMDA v. Energy Regulatory Commission (CRE),"On July 2023, two NGOs (Nuestros Derechos al Futuro y Medio Ambiente Sano, A.C. and Centro Mexicano de Derecho Ambiental) filed a lawsuit against the Energy Regulatory Commission (Comision Reguladora de Energia or CRE), challenging the Resolution No. A/018/2023 of the Energy Regulatory Commission, which updates the reference values of the methodologies for calculating the efficiency of electric energy cogeneration systems and the criteria for determining efficient cogeneration, as well as the efficiency criteria and calculation methodology for determining the percentage of fuel-free energy established in Resolutions RES/003/2011, RES/206/2014, RES/291/2012 and RES/1838/2016, respectively. 

Essentially, the challenged resolution allows to consider as clean energy a fraction of the electricity generated by fossil gas-fired combined cycle power plants, relaxing the criteria for efficient cogeneration and the definition of fuel-free electricity generation. The organizations argue that this agreement violated the right to a healthy environment, because it promotes the use of fossil fuels to generate energy that can be classified as ""clean"". The consequence of the agreement is that the percentage of clean energy generated in Mexico will falsely increase, but greenhouse gas emissions will not be reduced. In addition, it is argued that this measure is regressive, since it eliminates the incentive to promote the generation of renewable energy and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These modifications encourage the oil industry to continue generating electricity, halting the energy transition in Mexico.

On July 21, 2023, the First District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications denied the requested injunction to suspend the effects of the contested resolution.
